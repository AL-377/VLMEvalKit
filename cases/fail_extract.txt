Okay, let's see. I need to figure out the missing values for Company 2. The problem gives me a formula for Owners' Equity: Beginning Balance plus Net Income minus Net Loss plus Investments minus Distributions equals Ending Balance. 

So, for Company 2, the numbers are:

Beginning Balance: $63,180

Net Income: $0

Net Loss: $12,000

Investments: $0

Distributions: $51,180

Ending Balance: ?

The formula is:

Ending Balance = Beginning Balance + Net Income - Net Loss + Investments - Distributions

Let me plug in the numbers step by step. 

Starting with the Beginning Balance: $63,180.

Then add Net Income: $0. So that's still $63,180.

Next, subtract Net Loss: $12,000. So, 63,180 - 12,000 = $51,180.

Then add Investments: $0. Still $51,180.

Subtract Distributions: $51,180 - 51,180 = $0.

Wait, but the Ending Balance is supposed to be something else. The options are A. $1,620, B. $12,000, C. $51,180, D. $0. But according to my calculation, the Ending Balance should be $0. But that's not one of the options. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake.

Wait, let me check again. Maybe the formula is different. Let me read the problem again. The formula is:

Ending Balance = Beginning Balance + Net Income - Net Loss + Investments - Distributions

So, for Company 2:

Ending Balance = 63,180 + 0 - 12,000 + 0 - 51,180

Calculating that:

63,180 - 12,000 = 51,180

51,180 - 51,180 = 0

So, the Ending Balance is $0. But the options don't have $0. Wait, maybe I misread the problem. Let me check again.

Wait, the problem says "Calculate the missing values of company 2." The options are A to D. But according to my calculation, the Ending Balance is $0, which is not an option. That can't be right. Maybe I messed up the formula.

Wait, maybe the formula is different. Let me check the structure again. The formula is:

Ending Balance = Beginning Balance + Net Income - Net Loss + Investments - Distributions

Yes, that's what's written. So, for Company 2, the Ending Balance is 63,180 + 0 - 12,000 + 0 - 51,180 = 0. But the options don't include $0. That's confusing. Maybe the question is different? Wait, maybe the formula is written differently. Let me check the original problem again.

Looking at the table:

For Company 2:

Beginning Balance: 63,180

Net Income: 0

Net Loss: 12,000

Investments: 0

Distributions: 51,180

Ending Balance: ?

The formula is written as:

Ending Balance = Beginning Balance + Net Income - Net Loss + Investments - Distributions

So, substituting:

Ending Balance = 63,180 + 0 - 12,000 + 0 - 51,180

Calculating step by step:

63,180 - 12,000 = 51,180

51,180 - 51,180 = 0

So, the Ending Balance is $0. But the options don't have $0. That's a problem. Maybe the question is expecting a different approach? Wait, perhaps the Investments are not added but something else? Let me check the problem statement again.

Wait, the problem says "Investments" in the formula. Maybe Investments are not added but something else. Wait, the formula is written as:

Ending Balance = Beginning Balance + Net Income - Net Loss + Investments - Distributions

So, Investments are added. But in Company 2, Investments are $0. So, that term is zero. So, the calculation is correct. Then why is $0 not an option? The options are A. $1,620, B. $12,000, C. $51,180, D. $0. So, D is an option. But according to the calculation, the Ending Balance is $0. So, the answer should be D. But maybe the problem is expecting a different interpretation?

Wait, maybe the formula is written incorrectly. Let me check again. The formula is:

Ending Balance = Beginning Balance + Net Income - Net Loss + Investments - Distributions

Yes. So, for Company 2, the Ending Balance is $0. But the options don't have $0. That's conflicting. Maybe the question is a trick question? Or perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, let's recalculate:

63,180 (beginning) + 0 (net income) - 12,000 (net loss) + 0 (investments) - 51,180 (distributions)

So:

63,180 - 12,000 = 51,180

51,180 - 51,180 = 0

Yes, that's correct. So, the Ending Balance is $0. But the options don't include $0. Wait, maybe the question is in another currency? But the numbers are in dollars. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe the Investments are not added but something else. Wait, the formula is written as "+ Investments". So, Investments are added. So, if Investments are $0, then that term is zero. So, the calculation is correct. Therefore, the answer should be D. $0. But the options don't have D. Wait, the options are A. $1,620, B. $12,000, C. $51,180, D. $0. So, D is an option. Therefore, the answer is D. But why is the Ending Balance $0? Maybe the company is liquidated? But the problem doesn't state that. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe there's a mistake in the problem statement. Let me check again. The problem says "Calculate the missing values of company 2." The options are given. So, according to the calculation, the Ending Balance is $0, which is option D. Therefore, the answer should be D. But maybe the problem expects a different approach. Wait, perhaps the formula is different. Let me check the original problem again.

Looking at the table again:

The formula is written as:

Ending Balance = Beginning Balance + Net Income - Net Loss + Investments - Distributions

Yes. So, for Company 2, the calculation is correct. Therefore, the answer is D. $0. But the options don't have D. Wait, maybe the problem is in another language, and the translation is off? Or maybe there's a typo in the problem. Alternatively, maybe I misread the problem.

Wait, let me check the problem again. The user provided the table with the formula. For Company 2, the Ending Balance is missing. The options are A to D. The calculation gives $0, which is option D. So, the answer should be D. But maybe the problem expects a different answer. Let me check once more.

Wait, perhaps the Investments are not added but something else. Wait, the formula is written as "+ Investments". So, Investments are added. So, if Investments are $0, then that term is zero. So, the calculation is correct. Therefore, the answer is D. $0. But the options don't have D. Wait, the options are A. $1,620, B. $12,000, C. $51,180, D. $0. So, D is an option. Therefore, the answer is D. But maybe the problem is designed to trick you into thinking that Investments are not added. But according to the formula, they are. So, unless there's a mistake in the problem, the answer should be D. $0. But since the options don't have D, maybe there's a mistake in the problem. Alternatively, maybe the question is in another language, and the translation is off. But given the information, I think the answer is D. $0.

To determine the missing values for Company 2, we use the formula for Owners' Equity:

\[
\text{Ending Balance} = \text{Beginning Balance} + \text{Net Income} - \text{Net Loss} + \text{Investments} - \text{Distributions}
\]

For Company 2:
- **Beginning Balance**: \$63,180
- **Net Income**: \$0
- **Net Loss**: \$12,000
- **Investments**: \$0
- **Distributions**: \$51,180

Substituting these values into the formula:
\[
\text{Ending Balance} = 63,180 + 0 - 12,000 + 0 - 51,180
\]
\[
= 63,180 - 12,000 - 51,180
\]
\[
= 51,180 - 51,180
\]
\[
= 0
\]

The Ending Balance for Company 2 is \$0, which corresponds to **Option D**.

**Answer:** \boxed{D}
