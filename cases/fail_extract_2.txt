Okay, let's see. I need to find the probability that path B-D will be finished in 22 weeks or less. Hmm, first, I should figure out what path B-D is. Looking at the table, Activity D has an immediate predecessor B. So path B-D is B followed by D. 

Now, to find the probability that this path takes 22 weeks or less, I need to calculate the expected time and the variance for path B-D. Since the activity times are independent and normally distributed, the total time for the path should also be normally distributed. 

First, let's find the expected time for each activity. For Activity B, the expected time is m, which is 10 weeks. For Activity D, the expected time is also m, which is 8 weeks. So the expected time for path B-D is 10 + 8 = 18 weeks. 

Next, I need the variances of each activity. The variance for a normal distribution is (b - a)/3. For Activity B, the variance is (16 - 4)/3 = 12/3 = 4. For Activity D, the variance is (11 - 5)/3 = 6/3 = 2. Since the activities are independent, the total variance for the path is the sum of the variances. So 4 + 2 = 6. 

Therefore, the total time for path B-D is normally distributed with mean 18 and variance 6. To find the probability that it's finished in 22 weeks or less, I need to standardize this value. 

The formula for the z-score is (X - μ)/σ. Here, X is 22, μ is 18, and σ is the square root of the variance, which is sqrt(6) ≈ 2.4495. 

Calculating the z-score: (22 - 18)/2.4495 ≈ 4/2.4495 ≈ 1.6329. 

Now, I need to find the probability that a standard normal variable is less than or equal to 1.6329. Using a z-table or calculator, the cumulative probability for z = 1.63 is approximately 0.9484. 

Wait, let me double-check that. If the z-score is 1.63, then the probability is indeed around 0.9484. That means there's about a 94.84% chance that path B-D will be finished in 22 weeks or less. 

But let me make sure I didn't mix up any steps. The key points are: 

1. Path B-D is B followed by D. 
2. Expected time is 10 + 8 = 18. 
3. Variances are 4 and 2, total variance 6. 
4. Standard deviation is sqrt(6). 
5. Z-score is (22 - 18)/sqrt(6) ≈ 1.63. 
6. Probability from z-table is ~0.9484. 

Yes, that seems right. So the probability is approximately 0.9484, which is 94.84%. 

I think that's all. Let me just check if there's any other consideration. The problem states that the activity times are independent, which is important because variance adds up. Also, the path is B-D, so the order is correct. The a, m, b times are all given, so I used the correct values. 

Another thing to verify: the variance for each activity. For Activity B, a=4, m=10, b=16. So (16 - 4)/3 = 4. Correct. For D, a=5, m=8, b=11. (11 - 5)/3 = 2. Correct. Sum is 6. Correct. 

So, yes, the steps are correct. The answer should be approximately 0.9484, which is 94.84%.

To determine the probability that path B-D will be finished in 22 weeks or less, we first calculate the expected time and variance for the path. 

**Expected Time:**
- Activity B: \( E[B] = 10 \) weeks
- Activity D: \( E[D] = 8 \) weeks
- Total expected time: \( E[B-D] = 10 + 8 = 18 \) weeks

**Variance:**
- Activity B: \( \text{Var}(B) = \frac{16 - 4}{3} = 4 \)
- Activity D: \( \text{Var}(D) = \frac{11 - 5}{3} = 2 \)
- Total variance: \( \text{Var}(B-D) = 4 + 2 = 6 \)

**Standard Deviation:**
- \( \sigma = \sqrt{6} \approx 2.4495 \)

**Z-Score Calculation:**
- \( Z = \frac{22 - 18}{2.4495} \approx 1.6329 \)

**Probability:**
- Using the standard normal distribution, \( P(Z \leq 1.63) \approx 0.9484 \)

**Final Answer:**
The probability that path B-D will be finished in 22 weeks or less is approximately \boxed{0.9484}.
