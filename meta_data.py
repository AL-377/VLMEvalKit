### Welcome to the OpenVLM Leaderboard! On this leaderboard we share the evaluation results of VLMs obtained by the OpenSource Framework:
### [*VLMEvalKit*: A Toolkit for Evaluating Large Vision-Language Models](https://github.com/open-compass/VLMEvalKit) üèÜ
### Currently, OpenVLM Leaderboard covers {} different VLMs (including GPT-4v, Gemini, QwenVLPlus, LLaVA, etc.) and {} different multi-modal benchmarks. 

This leaderboard was last updated: {}. 

OpenVLM Leaderboard only includes open-source VLMs or API models that are publicly available. To add your own model to the leaderboard, please create a PR in [VLMEvalKit](https://github.com/open-compass/VLMEvalKit) to support your VLM and then we will help with the evaluation and updating the leaderboard. For any questions or concerns, please feel free to contact us at [opencompass, duanhaodong]@pjlab.org.cn.

## Main Evaluation Results

- Metrics:
  - Avg Score: The average score on all VLM Benchmarks (normalized to 0 - 100, the higher the better). 
  - Avg Rank: The average rank on all VLM Benchmarks (the lower the better). 
  - Avg Score & Rank are calculated based on selected benchmark. **When results for some selected benchmarks are missing, Avg Score / Rank will be None!!!** 
- By default, we present the overall evaluation results based on {len(DEFAULT_BENCH)} VLM benchmarks, sorted by the descending order of Avg Score. 
  - The following datasets are included in the main results: {', '.join(DEFAULT_BENCH)}. 
  - Detailed evaluation results for each dataset (included or not included in main) are provided in the consequent tabs.

- In MMVet Evaluation, we use GPT-4-Turbo (gpt-4-1106-preview) as the judge LLM to assign scores to the VLM outputs. We only perform the evaluation once due to the limited variance among results of multiple evaluation pass originally reported. 
- No specific prompt template adopted for **ALL VLMs**.

## MMMU Validation Evaluation Results

- For MMMU, we support the evaluation of the `dev` (150 samples) and `validation` (900 samples) set. Here we only report the results on the `validation` set. 
- **Answer Inference:**
  - For models with `interleave_generate` interface (accept interleaved images & texts as inputs), all testing samples can be inferred. **`interleave_generate` is adopted for inference.**
  - For models without `interleave_generate` interface, samples with more than one images are skipped (42 out of 1050, directly count as wrong). **`generate` is adopted for inference.**
- **Evaluation**:
  - MMMU include two types of questions: **multi-choice questions** & **open-ended QA**. 
  - For **open-ended QA (62/1050)**, we re-formulate it as multi-choice questions: `{'question': 'QQQ', 'answer': 'AAA'} -> {'question': 'QQQ', 'A': 'AAA', 'B': 'Other Answers', 'answer': 'A'}`, and then adopt the same evaluation paradigm for **multi-choice questions**. 
  - For **multi-choice questions (988/1050)**, we use **GPT-3.5-Turbo-0613** for matching prediction with options if heuristic matching does not work.

[**HallusionBench**](https://github.com/tianyi-lab/HallusionBench) is a benchmark to evaluate hallucination of VLMs. It asks a set of visual questions with one original image and one modified image (the answers for a question can be different, considering the image content). 

**Examples in HallusionBench:**

| Original Figure                                              | Modified Figure                                              |

| **Q3.** Is the right orange circle smaller than the left orange circle? **A3. No** | **Q3.** Is the right orange circle smaller than the left orange circle? **A3. No** |

**Metrics**:

>-  aAcc: The overall accuracy of **all** atomic questions. 
>
>- qAcc: The mean accuracy of unique **questions**. One question can be asked multiple times with different figures, we consider VLM correctly solved a unique question only if it succeeds in all <question, figure> pairs for this unique question.
>- fAcc: The mean accuracy of all **figures**. One figure is associated with multiple questions, we consider VLM correct on a figure only if it succeeds to solve all questions of this figure. 

**Evaluation Setting**:

> 1. **No-visual** Questions (questions asked without the associated figure) in HallusionBench are **skipped** during evaluation.
> 2. When we failed to extract Yes / No from the VLM prediction, we adopt **GPT-3.5-Turbo-0613** as the answer extractor.
> 3. We report aAcc, qAcc, and fAcc for all evaluated VLMs.

To reduce the data file size, we have kept only a single copy of the overlapping samples (about 5127 examples). However, the final accuracy will be calculated on the ~9k samples.
- Some API models, due to safety policies, refuse to answer certain questions, so their actual capabilities may be higher than the reported scores.
