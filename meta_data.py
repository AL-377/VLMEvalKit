## MMVet Evaluation Results

- In MMVet Evaluation, we use GPT-4-Turbo (gpt-4-1106-preview) as the judge LLM to assign scores to the VLM outputs. We only perform the evaluation once due to the limited variance among results of multiple evaluation pass originally reported. 
- No specific prompt template adopted for **ALL VLMs**.
- We also provide performance on the [**Official Leaderboard**](https://paperswithcode.com/sota/visual-question-answering-on-mm-vet) for models that are applicable. Those results are obtained with GPT-4-0314 evaluator (which has been deperacted for new users).

LEADERBOARD_MD['MMMU_VAL'] = """
## MMMU Validation Evaluation Results

- For MMMU, we support the evaluation of the `dev` (150 samples) and `validation` (900 samples) set. Here we only report the results on the `validation` set. 
- **Answer Inference:**
  - For models with `interleave_generate` interface (accept interleaved images & texts as inputs), all testing samples can be inferred. **`interleave_generate` is adopted for inference.**
  - For models without `interleave_generate` interface, samples with more than one images are skipped (42 out of 1050, directly count as wrong). **`generate` is adopted for inference.**
- **Evaluation**:
  - MMMU include two types of questions: **multi-choice questions** & **open-ended QA**. 
  - For **open-ended QA (62/1050)**, we re-formulate it as multi-choice questions: `{'question': 'QQQ', 'answer': 'AAA'} -> {'question': 'QQQ', 'A': 'AAA', 'B': 'Other Answers', 'answer': 'A'}`, and then adopt the same evaluation paradigm for **multi-choice questions**. 
  - For **multi-choice questions (988/1050)**, we use **GPT-3.5-Turbo-0613** for matching prediction with options if heuristic matching does not work. 
"""

LEADERBOARD_MD['MathVista'] = """
## MMMU TestMini Evaluation Results

- We report the evaluation results on MathVista **TestMini**, which include 1000 test samples. 
- We adopt `GPT-4-Turbo (1106)` as the answer extractor when we failed to extract the answer with heuristic matching. 
- The performance of **Human  (High school)** and **Random Choice** are copied from the official leaderboard. 
**Category Definitions:** **FQA:** figure QA, **GPS:** geometry problem solving, **MWP:** math word problem, **TQA:** textbook QA, **VQA:** visual QA, **ALG:** algebraic, **ARI:** arithmetic, **GEO:** geometry, **LOG:** logical , **NUM:** numeric, **SCI:** scientific, **STA:** statistical.

LEADERBOARD_MD['HallusionBench'] = """
[**HallusionBench**](https://github.com/tianyi-lab/HallusionBench) is a benchmark to evaluate hallucination of VLMs. It asks a set of visual questions with one original image and one modified image (the answers for a question can be different, considering the image content). 

**Examples in HallusionBench:**

| Original Figure                                              | Modified Figure                                              |
| ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| ![](http://opencompass.openxlab.space/utils/Hallu0.png) | ![](http://opencompass.openxlab.space/utils/Hallu1.png) |
| **Q1.** Is the right orange circle the same size as the left orange circle? **A1. Yes** | **Q1.** Is the right orange circle the same size as the left orange circle? **A1. No** |
| **Q2.** Is the right orange circle larger than the left orange circle? **A2. No** | **Q2.** Is the right orange circle larger than the left orange circle? **A2. Yes** |
| **Q3.** Is the right orange circle smaller than the left orange circle? **A3. No** | **Q3.** Is the right orange circle smaller than the left orange circle? **A3. No** |

**Metrics**:

>-  aAcc: The overall accuracy of **all** atomic questions. 
>
>- qAcc: The mean accuracy of unique **questions**. One question can be asked multiple times with different figures, we consider VLM correctly solved a unique question only if it succeeds in all <question, figure> pairs for this unique question.
>- fAcc: The mean accuracy of all **figures**. One figure is associated with multiple questions, we consider VLM correct on a figure only if it succeeds to solve all questions of this figure. 

**Evaluation Setting**:

> 1. **No-visual** Questions (questions asked without the associated figure) in HallusionBench are **skipped** during evaluation.
> 2. When we failed to extract Yes / No from the VLM prediction, we adopt **GPT-3.5-Turbo-0613** as the answer extractor.
> 3. We report aAcc, qAcc, and fAcc for all evaluated VLMs.
