Okay, let's see. The question is whether the chromatic scale starting on Bb is correctly written. The options are True or False. The scale is written on the treble clef with a Bb clef sign. Let me break this down.

First, a chromatic scale is a sequence of notes ascending or descending through all the 12 semitones in an octave, each note a half-step apart. So, starting on Bb, the next note should be Bb# (Bb sharp), then Cb (C flat), Dbb (D flat), Ebb (E flat), Fb (F flat), Gb (G flat), then back up to Bb. Wait, but in a chromatic scale, each note is a half-step. So starting on Bb, the sequence would be:

1. Bb
2. Bb# (Bb sharp)
3. Cb (C flat)
4. Dbb (D flat)
5. Ebb (E flat)
6. Fb (F flat)
7. Gb (G flat)
8. A# (A sharp)
9. Bb (back to the original note)

But wait, when you go up the chromatic scale, you have to go through all the flats and sharps. Let me check the given scale.

Looking at the notes written: Bb, Cb, Dbb, Ebb, Fb, Gb, A#, Bb. That's seven notes. But a chromatic scale should have 12 notes. So this is only the first seven notes. Then, to complete the octave, you would need to go up another five notes: A#, Bb, Cb, Dbb, Ebb, Fb, Gb, A#, Bb. Wait, but the given scale stops at A#, which is the 8th note. Then the next note would be Bb again, which is the 9th note. But the question is about the chromatic scale starting on Bb. So the correct chromatic scale should have 12 notes. Therefore, the given scale is incomplete. It's only the first seven notes of the chromatic scale. So the answer should be False.

But wait, let me confirm. The chromatic scale is a series of half-steps. Starting on Bb, the next note is Bb#, then Cb, Dbb, Ebb, Fb, Gb, A#, then back to Bb. So that's 12 notes. But in the given scale, they only have Bb, Cb, Dbb, Ebb, Fb, Gb, A#. That's 7 notes. So the answer is False. Therefore, the correct option is B. False.

The chromatic scale starting on Bb should include all 12 semitones, ascending and descending. The given scale only shows the first seven notes (Bb, Cb, Dbb, Ebb, Fb, Gb, A#), missing the subsequent notes (Bb, Cb, Dbb, Ebb, Fb, Gb, A#) to complete the octave. Thus, the statement is **False**.

**Answer:** B. False
