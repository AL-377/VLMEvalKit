Okay, let's see. The question is asking what material the chair in the image is made of. The options are cast iron, plastic, steel, or plywood. 

First, I need to look closely at the chair's structure. The frame seems to have a dark color, almost black. The legs and the armrests look like they're made of a solid material. The seat and backrest are bright red and blue, which might be painted or covered with some material. 

Looking at the legs, they have a square shape with some yellow accents at the corners. The joints where the legs connect to the seat and backrest are also yellow. That might be a type of metal, like steel, which is often used in furniture for its strength. Cast iron is usually darker and has a different texture. Plastic would be lighter and maybe have a different finish. Plywood is made of layers of wood, so it might have a grain pattern or a different texture.

The frame's structure looks sturdy and industrial. The legs are connected with metal brackets, which could be steel. The seat and backrest are flat panels, possibly metal sheets painted red and blue. The armrests are also part of the frame, so they might be made of the same material as the legs. 

Another thing to consider is the overall design. This chair is known as the Red and Blue Chair, designed by Gerrit Rietveld. It's a classic example of De Stijl furniture, which often uses simple geometric shapes and primary colors. The materials used here are typically metal and painted surfaces. 

So, considering the dark frame, the metal-looking joints, and the industrial design, I think the material is most likely steel. Plastic would be too soft and not hold up the structure, and plywood would show more texture. Cast iron is possible but usually has a rougher surface. 

Therefore, the answer should be C. steel.

The chair's frame has a dark, sturdy structure with metal joints and brackets, characteristic of steel. The geometric design and industrial aesthetic align with De Stijl furniture, which often uses metal for strength and simplicity. Plastic and plywood lack the durability and structural integrity observed in the image. 

**Answer:** C. steel
