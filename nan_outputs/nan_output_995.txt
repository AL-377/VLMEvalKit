Okay, let's see. The question is about calculating something from the given table about smoking and lung cancer. The options are PAR, AR, RR, OR. Hmm. I need to remember what each of these stands for. 

First, PAR is probably the Population Attributable Risk. That's the proportion of cases in a population that can be attributed to a particular exposure. But how do you calculate that? I think it requires knowing the prevalence of the exposure and the relative risk. The formula is PAR = (Prevalence of exposure) * (Relative Risk - 1). But I'm not sure if that's directly calculable from the table. Maybe not. 

Then AR is Absolute Risk. That's the difference in risk between exposed and unexposed groups. Like, if smokers have a 10% higher risk than non-smokers, the AR would be 10%. But again, I don't see the data for the total number of people in each group. The table gives numbers of patients, not the total population. So maybe AR isn't directly calculable here. 

RR is Relative Risk. That's the ratio of the risk in the exposed group to the risk in the unexposed group. So RR = (Risk in smokers) / (Risk in non-smokers). Let's check the numbers. For lung cancer patients: smokers have 150, non-smokers 100. So RR would be 150/100 = 1.5. For non-lung cancer patients: smokers 50, non-smokers 200. RR is 50/200 = 0.25. So RR is different for different outcomes. But the question is asking what can be calculated from these data. So RR is one of the options. 

OR is Odds Ratio. That's the ratio of the odds of exposure in the case group to the odds in the control group. So OR = (150/50) / (100/200) = (3) / (0.5) = 6. So OR is 6. But the question is about the relationship between smoking and lung cancer. So OR is a measure of association. 

But the question is asking what can be calculated from these data. The table gives the numbers of patients in each category. So for RR, we can calculate it for lung cancer and non-lung cancer separately. For OR, we can calculate it as well. But the options are PAR, AR, RR, OR. 

Wait, the question is about the relationship between smoking and lung cancer. So maybe they want the RR for lung cancer. The table shows 150 smokers with lung cancer and 50 non-smokers. So RR is 150/50 = 3. But the options include RR. So is that the answer? But let me check the other options. 

PAR requires knowing the prevalence of smoking in the population and the RR. Since we don't have the total population numbers, we can't calculate PAR. Similarly, AR would need the total number of people in each group, not just the number of patients. So AR isn't calculable. 

Therefore, the only one that can be calculated from the given data is RR. So the answer is C. RR. 

Wait, but the table also has non-lung cancer patients. Does that affect anything? Maybe not, because the question is about the relationship between smoking and lung cancer. So even though there's data on non-lung cancer, it's not necessary for calculating RR for lung cancer. So yes, RR is calculable. 

Therefore, the correct answer is C. RR.

The table provides data on lung cancer patients and non-lung cancer patients stratified by smoking status. To determine the relationship between smoking and lung cancer, we can calculate the **Relative Risk (RR)**. 

- **Smokers with lung cancer**: 150  
- **Non-smokers with lung cancer**: 100  

The RR is calculated as:  
\[
\text{RR} = \frac{\text{Risk in smokers}}{\text{Risk in non-smokers}} = \frac{150}{100} = 1.5
\]

Other options (PAR, AR, OR) require additional data (e.g., total population, prevalence of smoking, odds) that are not provided in the table. Thus, **RR** is the only calculable measure from the given data.

**Answer:** C. RR
