Okay, let's see. The question is about terms that refer to stories portraying the ruling class as heroic and benevolent. The options are A. Retold Tale, B. Tall Tale, C. Humorous Tale, D. Castle Tales. 

First, I need to understand each term. A Retold Tale is just a story that's been told again, maybe with some changes. A Tall Tale is a story that's exaggerated, like those from the Old West where people tell big stories. Humorous Tale is a story that's funny, maybe with jokes. Castle Tales... Hmm, that sounds specific. Maybe it's a term used for stories set in castles or about nobility? 

The key here is "portray the ruling class as heroic and benevolent." So we're looking for a term that specifically refers to stories about the upper class being good. Tall Tale might not fit because those are usually about over-the-top exaggerations. Retold Tale is too general. Humorous Tale could be about funny stories, but not necessarily about the ruling class. 

Castle Tales... Maybe that's a specific term for stories set in castles, like chivalric romances? Those often feature knights and nobles as heroes. So if the question is about stories that show the ruling class as heroic and good, then Castle Tales might be the answer. But I need to make sure. 

Wait, the options are given, and the term "Castle Tales" is an option. Maybe it's a play on words? Like, tales from castles, which are associated with the ruling class. So the answer is D. Castle Tales.

The term "Castle Tales" refers to stories that often depict the ruling class as heroic and benevolent, such as chivalric romances. While other options like "Tall Tale" (exaggerated) or "Humorous Tale" (funny) donâ€™t align with the heroic and benevolent portrayal, "Castle Tales" directly ties to narratives set in castles, which historically associated nobility with power and virtue. 

**Answer:** D. Castle Tales
