Okay, let's try to figure out this question. The patient is a 61-year-old woman with a change in her right breast over 7 months. The physical exam shows indurated, roughened, reddish-orange skin, nipple retraction, and the gross appearance of the mastectomy specimen looks like what's shown in the image. The options are A to D, with C being Phyllodes tumor.

First, I need to recall what each of these tumors looks like. Intraductal carcinoma is usually a non-invasive ductal carcinoma, so it might present differently. Lobular carcinoma in situ is also non-invasive, affecting lobules. Infiltrating ductal carcinoma is invasive, which would have spread beyond the ducts. Phyllodes tumor is a stromal tumor, which can be benign or malignant. The gross appearance here shows a large mass with a nodular, lobulated surface, which is characteristic of a phyllodes tumor. The reddish-orange skin and induration might be due to the tumor's size and the surrounding stroma causing inflammation or fibrosis. Nipple retraction is common in phyllodes tumors because of the mass effect. 

Intraductal carcinoma usually presents with clustered microcalcifications on mammography, not the gross appearance here. Lobular carcinoma in situ is usually a flat, non-palpable lesion. Infiltrating ductal carcinoma would have a more infiltrative, possibly irregular margin, but the gross appearance here seems more lobulated. Phyllodes tumor's gross features are often described as having a leaf-like or lobulated surface, which matches the image. The reddish-orange color might be due to blood supply or inflammation. 

So, considering the clinical presentation and the gross appearance, the most likely diagnosis is Phyllodes tumor. The other options don't fit as well. Let me double-check. Intraductal carcinoma is usually in the ducts, not a large mass. Lobular carcinoma in situ is in the lobules. Infiltrating ductal carcinoma is invasive, but the gross appearance here doesn't look infiltrative. Phyllodes tumor's stromal component would explain the induration and reddish color. So I think the answer is C.

The patient's clinical presentation, including indurated skin, reddish-orange discoloration, and nipple retraction, along with the gross appearance of a lobulated, leaf-like mass, strongly suggests a **Phyllodes tumor**. Phyllodes tumors are stromal neoplasms that often present with a palpable, firm mass and may cause skin changes due to fibrosis and inflammation. The options for invasive ductal carcinoma (A) and lobular carcinoma in situ (D) are less likely, as they typically present with microcalcifications or flat lesions, respectively. Intraductal carcinoma (B) is non-invasive and usually detected via mammography. 

**Answer:** C. Phyllodes tumor
