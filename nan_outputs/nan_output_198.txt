Okay, so I need to figure out the orientation of the Purkinje cell dendrites relative to the granule cell axons. The options are perpendicular or parallel. Let me start by recalling some basic anatomy of the cerebellum, where Purkinje cells and granule cells are located.

Purkinje cells are the large, granule-shaped neurons in the cerebellar cortex. Their dendrites are the long, branching structures that receive input from other neurons. Granule cells are the small, star-shaped neurons that send their axons into the molecular layer. The axons of granule cells form the mossy fibers, which synapse onto the Purkinje cell dendrites.

Now, the question is about the orientation of the Purkinje cell dendrites versus the granule cell axons. I remember that in the cerebellum, the granule cell axons (mossy fibers) enter the molecular layer and then synapse onto the Purkinje cell dendrites. The Purkinje cell dendrites are arranged in a specific way. If I imagine looking at a cross-section of the cerebellar cortex, the Purkinje cell dendrites would be extending from the Purkinje cell bodies towards the molecular layer. The granule cell axons come from the granule cell layer, which is below the Purkinje cell layer. So, the axons would be coming from the granule cell layer and entering the molecular layer, where they synapse onto the Purkinje cell dendrites.

If I think about the orientation, the Purkinje cell dendrites are vertical, extending from the Purkinje cell bodies into the molecular layer. The granule cell axons are horizontal, coming from the granule cell layer and entering the molecular layer. So, the dendrites are vertical, and the axons are horizontal. That would make them perpendicular to each other. So the answer should be A. Perpendicular.

Wait, but let me double-check. Sometimes in diagrams, especially in textbooks, the orientation might be depicted differently. But generally, in the cerebellar cortex, the Purkinje cell dendrites are indeed oriented vertically, and the granule cell axons are horizontal. So their directions are perpendicular. Therefore, the correct answer is A.

The Purkinje cell dendrites extend vertically from their bodies into the molecular layer, while the granule cell axons (mossy fibers) enter the molecular layer horizontally from the granule cell layer. These orientations are perpendicular to each other. 

**Answer:** A. Perpendicular.
