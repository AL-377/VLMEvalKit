Okay, let's see. The question is asking about the type of matrix traversal shown in the image. The options are normal, row-wise, column-wise, or spiral. Hmm. Let me try to visualize the matrix and the traversal path.

First, the matrix is 4x4, right? The numbers are arranged in a grid from 1 to 16. The output sequence given is 1, 2, 3, 4, 8, 12, 16, 15, 14, 13, 9, 5, 6, 7, 11, 10. Let me try to map this step by step.

Starting at 1, then moving right to 2, 3, 4. Then down to 8. Then left to 12. Then up to 16. Then left to 15, down to 14, left to 13, up to 9. Then right to 5, 6, 7, then up to 11, left to 10. Wait, that seems like a spiral pattern. Let me check again.

Starting at the top-left corner (1), moving right to the end of the first row (4). Then down to the last element of the fourth column (8). Then moving left to the second last element (12). Then up to the second last element of the first row (16). Then left to the third last element (15), down to the third last element of the fourth column (14), left to the third last element of the second row (13), up to the third last element of the first row (9). Then right to the second last element of the second row (5), 6, 7, then up to the second last element of the first row (11), left to the second last element of the fourth column (10). 

Yes, that's a spiral traversal. It starts at the top-left, moves right, then down, then left, then up, and so on, forming a spiral. So the order is moving in a spiral direction, which is option D. Let me check the other options to be sure.

Option A: Normal traversal. That would be row-wise, right? Like 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16. But the given output skips some numbers and goes in a different order, so that's not normal.

Option B: Row-wise. That would be each row from left to right. But the output here goes 1,2,3,4, then skips 5,6,7,8, then 9,10,11,12, then skips 13,14,15,16. So it's not row-wise. It's skipping entire rows.

Option C: Column-wise. That would be each column from top to bottom. But the output here doesn't follow that. For example, after 4, it goes to 8 (down), then 12 (left), then 16 (up), then 15 (left), 14 (down), 13 (left), 9 (up), etc. So column-wise would be going down each column, but here it's moving in a spiral, not column-wise.

So the correct answer must be D, spiral traversal.

The traversal follows a spiral pattern, starting from the top-left corner and moving right, down, left, and up in a clockwise manner. This is characteristic of a spiral traversal. 

**Answer:** D. spiral traversal of the matrix.
