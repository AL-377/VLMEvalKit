Okay, so I need to figure out the equilibrium quantity of Frisbees based on the given demand and supply schedules. Let me start by recalling what equilibrium means in economics. Equilibrium occurs when the quantity demanded equals the quantity supplied. So, I need to find the price where these two quantities meet, and then that price will correspond to the equilibrium quantity.

Looking at the table provided, the columns are Price per Frisbee, Quantity Demanded, and Quantity Supplied. The rows list different prices and the corresponding quantities. My task is to find the price where the quantity demanded equals the quantity supplied. Once I find that price, the quantity at that price is the equilibrium quantity.

Let me list out the prices and their corresponding quantities:

At $11: Demand is 1 million, Supply is 15 million. Clearly, supply is higher here, so the market is in surplus.

At $10: Demand is 2 million, Supply is 12 million. Still, supply is higher. Surplus continues.

At $9: Demand is 4 million, Supply is 9 million. Now, supply is 9 million and demand is 4 million. So, the market is in surplus here as well. Wait, but maybe the surplus is getting smaller?

At $8: Demand is 6 million, Supply is 6 million. Oh, here both are equal. That must be the equilibrium point. Because at this price, the quantity demanded equals the quantity supplied. So, the equilibrium quantity is 6 million Frisbees.

But let me check the next price to make sure. At $7: Demand is 8 million, Supply is 3 million. Here, demand is higher than supply, so there's a shortage. At $6: Demand is 10 million, Supply is 1 million. Again, demand is way higher than supply. So, the only price where they meet is $8 with 6 million each. Therefore, the equilibrium quantity is 6 million.

Looking at the options, A is 6 million. So, the answer should be A.

To determine the equilibrium quantity of Frisbees, we need to find the price where the quantity demanded equals the quantity supplied. 

- At **$11**: Demand = 1 million, Supply = 15 million (surplus).
- At **$10**: Demand = 2 million, Supply = 12 million (surplus).
- At **$9**: Demand = 4 million, Supply = 9 million (surplus).
- At **$8**: Demand = 6 million, Supply = 6 million (equilibrium).
- At **$7**: Demand = 8 million, Supply = 3 million (shortage).
- At **$6**: Demand = 10 million, Supply = 1 million (shortage).

The equilibrium occurs at **$8**, where both quantities are equal (6 million). Thus, the equilibrium quantity is **6 million**.

**Answer:** A. 6 million
