Okay, let's see. The question is asking whether the note shown is the leading note in E major. The options are True or False. 

First, I need to recall what the leading note is. The leading note, also known as the subtonic, is the note that resolves to the tonic in a major scale. In a major scale, the leading note is the seventh degree, which is a half-step below the tonic. For example, in C major, the leading note is B, because B is a half-step below C. So, in E major, the leading note should be a half-step below E, which would be D#. 

Now, looking at the note in the image. It's a C note with a flat accidental. Wait, but the question is about the leading note in E major. If the note is a C with a flat, that would be C#, right? Because a flat lowers the note by a half-step. So if the leading note in E major is D#, then a C# would be the correct note. But the note here is C with a flat, which is C#. Hmm, maybe I'm confused here.

Wait, let me double-check. The leading note in E major is the seventh degree. Let's list the notes of E major. The major scale formula is 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8. So starting on E, the notes would be E, F#, G#, A, B, C#, D#, E. So the seventh degree is D#. Therefore, the leading note is D#. 

But the note shown in the image is a C with a flat. Wait, that's C#. Because a flat lowers the note by a half-step. So if the note is C with a flat, that's C#. But D# is the leading note. So if the note is C#, that's not the leading note. Therefore, the answer should be False. 

But wait, maybe there's a mistake in my reasoning. Let me confirm again. The leading note is the seventh degree, which in E major is D#. So the note should be D#. But the image shows a C with a flat, which is C#. So that's not D#. Therefore, the answer is False. 

Alternatively, maybe the question is about the leading note in E minor? Wait, no, the question specifies E major. So the leading note is D#. Therefore, the note in the image is C#, which is not D#. So the statement is false. 

Therefore, the correct answer is B. False.

The leading note in E major is the seventh degree of the scale, which is D#. The note shown in the image is a C with a flat (C#), which is not D#. Therefore, the statement is **False**.

**Answer:** B. False
