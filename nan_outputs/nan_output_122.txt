Okay, let's see. The question is asking which movement of art this painting belongs to. The options are Neoclassical, Baroque, Renaissance, or Rococo. Hmm. First, I need to recall the characteristics of each movement to figure this out.

Starting with the painting itself. It's a classical scene with figures dressed in togas, which makes me think of ancient Rome or Greece. The architecture in the background has columns and arches, which are typical of classical architecture. The figures are depicted in a dramatic pose, with one man holding a sword and another reaching out to take it. The composition seems formal and balanced, with a strong sense of order and symmetry.

Now, let's go through each option. 

Neoclassical art is known for its return to classical ideals, emphasizing order, symmetry, and idealized figures. The painting's classical elements like togas, columns, and the formal composition align with Neoclassical principles. Artists like Jacques-Louis David were famous for this style, often depicting historical or mythological scenes with strict attention to classical proportions and idealized beauty.

Baroque art, on the other hand, is characterized by dramatic contrasts of light and shadow (chiaroscuro), dynamic movement, and emotional intensity. While the painting does have a sense of action, the overall composition isn't as chaotic as Baroque paintings usually are. The figures are still arranged in a somewhat formal way, which might not fit the Baroque style as well.

Renaissance art, which came before Baroque, is known for its realism, perspective, and humanism. The figures in this painting are stylized but not as realistic as Renaissance works, which often aimed for lifelike representation. Renaissance paintings often had more naturalistic settings and less idealized figures, so this might not fit.

Rococo art, which followed Baroque, is more ornate, with curves, lightness, and a focus on pleasure and luxury. The painting doesn't seem to have those characteristics. Instead, it's more austere and classical in style.

So, considering all these points, the painting's classical elements, formal composition, and idealized figures point towards Neoclassicism. The artist Jacques-Louis David was a prominent Neoclassical painter, and this style often depicted historical or mythological scenes with a focus on moral and political themes. The scene here seems to be a historical or political moment, which fits with Neoclassical themes.

Therefore, I think the correct answer is A. Neoclassical.

The painting exhibits characteristics of **Neoclassical** art. Its classical attire, symmetrical composition, and idealized figures align with the movement's emphasis on order, symmetry, and return to ancient Greek/Roman ideals. The formal, balanced arrangement and dramatic yet controlled pose of the figures further support this classification. 

**Answer:** A. Neoclassical
