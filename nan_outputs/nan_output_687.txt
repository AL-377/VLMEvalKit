Okay, let's try to figure out this question. The image is a cartoon that's supposed to represent Mintzberg's metaphor of the Battle of Passchendaele. The options are about mismatches between different things. 

First, I need to recall what I know about the Battle of Passchendaele. It was a World War I battle that was notoriously unsuccessful, with heavy losses on both sides. The terrain was muddy and difficult, which probably contributed to the high casualties. The cartoon shows a military officer presenting a strategy on a board, which is labeled "designed strategy." Then there's a scene of soldiers in the mud, with the text "the pity of war." 

The question is asking about the mismatch between what the picture is trying to convey. The options are about plans vs. actual combat, abstract thinking vs. terrain, theoretical vs. experience, etc. 

Looking at the options:

A. Plans and actual combat do not match. That seems possible because the strategy on the board might not have considered the harsh realities of the battlefield.

B. Catastrophic mismatch between abstract thinking and actual terrain. The terrain was indeed a problem, but the strategy might have been more about the plan rather than the terrain. The officer is talking about sending the cavalry through a hole, which might not have considered the terrain's challenges.

C. Theoretical knowledge vs. experience. Maybe the officer is a theorist who didn't learn from experience, but the question is about the mismatch in the metaphor.

D. Mismatch between abstract thinking and experience. This could be a possibility, but I need to think which one is more directly related.

The image shows the officer presenting a strategy (abstract thinking) that's supposed to work, but the actual combat (experience) is a disaster. The terrain is a part of the actual combat, so maybe the mismatch is between the abstract strategy and the actual terrain. But the officer's plan might not have considered the terrain's impact. 

Alternatively, the mismatch could be between the designed strategy (abstract) and the actual combat (experience). The officer's plan is abstract, but when implemented, the experience of the battlefield didn't align with it. 

Looking at the options again, B and D are similar. The answer might be B, because the terrain was a critical factor that the strategy didn't account for. The officer's abstract plan didn't consider the actual terrain's challenges, leading to a catastrophic mismatch. 

Option A is plans vs. actual combat, but the mismatch is more specific to the terrain. The actual combat is part of the mismatch, but the terrain is a component of that. 

So, the answer is likely B. The mismatch is between abstract thinking (the strategy) and the actual terrain, which made the plan ineffective. The other options are possible, but B seems to directly address the terrain's role in the mismatch.

The image illustrates a military officer’s abstract strategy (labeled "designed strategy") that fails in the harsh, muddy terrain of Passchendaele. The mismatch here is between **abstract thinking** (the officer’s plan) and **the actual terrain** (the battlefield’s challenges), leading to catastrophic outcomes. While options A and D involve plans vs. combat or abstract vs. experience, B specifically addresses the terrain’s role in the mismatch. 

**Answer:** B. A catastrophic mismatch between abstract thinking and actual terrain.
