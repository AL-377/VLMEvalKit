Okay, so I need to figure out which structure labeled as 112 in the posterior abdominal diagram is. The options are Oesophagus, Suprarenal gland, Hepatic flexure of colon, or Duodenum. Let me start by recalling the anatomy of the posterior abdominal cavity.

First, the posterior abdominal wall has several structures. The spine is there, and the major organs are the kidneys, adrenal glands, liver, pancreas, and parts of the intestines. The options given are Oesophagus, which is part of the digestive system, but that's anterior. The Suprarenal gland is the adrenal gland, which is on top of the kidneys. The Hepatic flexure of colon is part of the large intestine, specifically where the colon bends near the liver. The Duodenum is the first part of the small intestine, connected to the stomach.

Looking at the diagram, structure 112 is located near the middle of the abdominal cavity, below the diaphragm. Let me visualize the positions. The kidneys are usually near the lower back, and the adrenal glands are on top of them. The liver is on the right side. The duodenum is connected to the stomach and pancreas, but in the posterior view, it might be near the spine. The hepatic flexure is part of the colon, which is on the right side. The suprarenal gland is on top of the kidneys. The oesophagus is anterior, so not in the posterior view.

In the diagram, structure 112 is near the middle, below the diaphragm. If I can see the location of the kidneys, which are numbered 111 and 113. The suprarenal glands (112) are on top of the kidneys. So 112 is the suprarenal gland. The hepatic flexure (110) is on the right side, near the liver. The duodenum (109) is near the spine, connected to the pancreas. The oesophagus (107) is anterior, not posterior. So the answer should be B. Suprarenal gland.

The structure labeled 112 in the posterior abdominal diagram is the **Suprarenal gland** (adrenal gland), which is positioned on top of the kidneys (labeled 111 and 113). The other options—Oesophagus (anterior), Hepatic flexure of colon (right side), and Duodenum (near the spine)—are not located in the posterior abdominal cavity. 

**Answer:** B. Suprarenal gland
