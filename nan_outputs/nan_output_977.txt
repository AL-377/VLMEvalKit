Okay, let's see. The question is about interpreting a graph that shows the amount of effort people put into a task versus group size. The options are social loafing, social facilitation, group polarization, groupthink, and minority influence. Hmm.

First, I need to recall what each of these concepts means. Social loafing is when people put in less effort when working in a group compared to when they work alone. Social facilitation is the opposite; people perform better when in a group. Group polarization is when group discussions lead to more extreme opinions. Groupthink is when groups make bad decisions due to pressure to conform. Minority influence is when a minority opinion has a lasting effect on the majority.

Looking at the graph, the x-axis is group size, and the y-axis is amount of effort. The points start high when group size is small (like 1 person) and decrease as group size increases. The trend line also shows a downward curve, meaning effort decreases as group size grows. That seems to fit social loafing, where effort decreases with group size. Social facilitation would show higher effort as group size increases, which isn't the case here. Group polarization is about opinions becoming more extreme, not effort. Groupthink is about decision-making, not effort. Minority influence is when a minority opinion affects the majority, but the graph doesn't show that. So the answer must be A, social loafing.

The graph illustrates a negative correlation between group size and effort, where effort decreases as group size increases. This aligns with **social loafing**, where individuals exert less effort when working in a group compared to solo efforts. 

**Answer:** A. Social loafing
