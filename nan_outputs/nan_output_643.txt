Okay, let's see. The question is asking which term refers to the central message addressed in a play, the lesson learned. The options are A. Theme, B. Dialogue, C. Plot, D. Drama.

First, I need to recall what each of these terms means in the context of a play. Let's start with the options one by one.

A. Theme: I remember that the theme is the central message or idea of a work, often expressed through the characters' experiences and the plot. It's the underlying message that the author wants the audience to take away. So if the play has a central message, that would be the theme. That seems right.

B. Dialogue: Dialogue is the spoken conversation between characters. While dialogue can contribute to the plot and theme, it's not the central message itself. It's more about how the characters express their thoughts and emotions, which can support the theme but isn't the theme itself.

C. Plot: The plot is the sequence of events that make up the story. It's the structure of the play, how the events unfold. The plot is about what happens, but the theme is about what the play is saying about those events. So the plot is the story, the theme is the lesson or message.

D. Drama: Drama is a general term for a play or theatrical performance. It's the form in which the play is presented, not the specific content. So drama refers to the genre or type, not the central message.

So, putting this together, the central message of a play is the theme. The other options are either parts of the play (plot, dialogue) or the genre (drama), or they're not the main idea (dialogue). Therefore, the correct answer should be A. Theme.

The central message or underlying idea of a play is its **theme**, which encapsulates the lesson or moral it conveys. While dialogue, plot, and drama (the genre) are integral components of a play, they do not directly represent the overarching message. 

**Answer:** A. Theme
