Okay, let's see. The question is asking which term best describes the field that deals with living organisms and the laws and phenomena related to them. The options are A. Science Fiction, B. Biological Science, C. Physical Science or Natural Science, D. Applied Science.

First, I need to understand each option. Science Fiction is a genre of literature, movies, etc., that involves imaginary and speculative works, often involving science. So that's not about real organisms or phenomena. So A is probably not the answer.

Next, Biological Science. That sounds like it's related to biology, which is the study of living organisms. The term "biological science" seems to fit because biology is a branch of science that deals with life and living organisms. So B is a strong candidate.

Then, Physical Science or Natural Science. Physical Science is about the physical world, like physics, chemistry, etc. Natural Science would be broader, covering biology, chemistry, physics, etc. But the question specifies "living organisms," so maybe Physical Science is too narrow because it's about physical phenomena, not specifically life. Natural Science is more encompassing, but does it specifically include biology? Hmm. The options are a bit ambiguous here. The question is asking for the term that deals with living organisms, so maybe Biological Science is the correct answer. But Natural Science could also include biology. Wait, the options are separate: C is Physical Science or Natural Science. So the answer might be C if the question is considering Natural Science as the broader term that includes biology. But I need to check the exact wording.

The question says "the field that deals with living organisms and the laws and phenomena that relate to any organism or group of organisms." So the term should be the one that specifically includes biology. Science Fiction is out. Applied Science is about applying scientific knowledge to practical uses, which isn't about the study of organisms. So B is Biological Science. But wait, the options are C is Physical Science or Natural Science. If the question is asking for the broader category, then C might be correct. But the options are separate. Let me think again.

In standard categorization, Biological Science is a subset of Natural Science. So if the question is asking for the term that best describes the field dealing with living organisms, then Biological Science (B) is the answer. Physical Science (C) is about the physical world, not specifically life. So even though Natural Science (C) includes biology, the term "Biological Science" is more precise here. Therefore, the correct answer should be B.

The term that best describes the field dealing with living organisms and their phenomena is **Biological Science**. While **Natural Science** (option C) encompasses biology, chemistry, and physics, **Biological Science** specifically focuses on life and organisms. **Science Fiction** (A) and **Applied Science** (D) are unrelated to the study of living systems. 

**Answer:** B. Biological Science
