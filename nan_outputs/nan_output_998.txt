Okay, let's see. I need to calculate the odds ratio (OR) for this case-control study. The table provided has two groups: case and control. Each group is divided into those with and without a history of exposure. The numbers are as follows:

Case group:
- History of exposure: 400
- No history: 100

Control group:
- History of exposure: 100
- No history: 400

Total for both groups: 500 each.

Hmm, odds ratio. I remember that the OR is calculated by taking the odds of exposure in the case group divided by the odds in the control group. The formula is (a/c) / (d/b), where a, b, c, d are the counts in the table. Let me confirm that.

So, in the case group, the number with exposure is 400, and without is 100. So the odds of exposure in the case group would be 400/100 = 4. In the control group, the numbers are 100 with exposure and 400 without. So the odds there would be 100/400 = 0.25. Then the OR is 4 / 0.25 = 16. Wait, that's option B. But let me check again to make sure I didn't mix up the numbers.

Wait, maybe I should use the formula properly. Let me write it out step by step.

The formula for OR is (a*d)/(b*c). So plugging in the numbers:

a = 400 (case with exposure)
b = 100 (case without exposure)
c = 100 (control with exposure)
d = 400 (control without exposure)

So OR = (400 * 400) / (100 * 100) = (160,000) / (10,000) = 16. Yep, that's 16. So the answer should be B. 16. Let me just make sure I didn't transpose any numbers. The case group has 400 exposed and 100 not exposed. Control group has 100 exposed and 400 not exposed. So the cross product is 400*400 and 100*100. 400*400 is 160,000, 100*100 is 10,000. 160,000 divided by 10,000 is indeed 16. So that's correct. So the answer is B.

The odds ratio (OR) is calculated using the formula \(\text{OR} = \frac{(a \times d)}{(b \times c)}\), where \(a = 400\) (case with exposure), \(b = 100\) (case without exposure), \(c = 100\) (control with exposure), and \(d = 400\) (control without exposure). Plugging in the values:

\[
\text{OR} = \frac{(400 \times 400)}{(100 \times 100)} = \frac{160,000}{10,000} = 16
\]

**Answer:** B. 16
