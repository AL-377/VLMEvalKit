Okay, let's try to figure out this question. The image is of an ivory tip for a king's ceremonial scepter, showing a female ancestor spirit from Kongo, Western Africa, around 1800. The options are about continuities in world history. Let me go through each option one by one.

First, the scepter is a symbol of authority, so it's likely related to political power. The female ancestor spirit suggests a connection to traditional beliefs and possibly the idea that rulers derive their power from ancestors or spirits. Let's look at each option.

Option A: The power of traditional elites was continuously challenged by the emerging power of new elites. Hmm, the scepter is a traditional symbol, so maybe it's about maintaining traditional power rather than being challenged. But I'm not sure if this directly relates to the image. The image shows a traditional object, so maybe this option is about a broader historical trend, but the image itself might not illustrate a challenge to traditional elites.

Option B: The power of states was based on the ability of rulers to monopolize the use of violence. Well, the scepter is a symbol of authority, not necessarily violence. Monopolizing violence is more about controlling armies and police, which isn't directly shown here. The image is more about cultural symbols of authority rather than state violence.

Option C: Artists depended on royal patronage for their livelihoods. The scepter is an example of an artist's work, so maybe this option is saying that artists relied on royal commissions. The image shows a specific piece, so perhaps the continuity is that artists have always relied on patrons. But the image itself is a single example. The question is about continuities, so maybe this is a general trend rather than the image itself.

Option D: Rulers used religious imagery to legitimize their political authority. The female ancestor spirit is a religious figure, and the scepter itself is a political symbol. So combining religious imagery with political authority would be a way to legitimize rule. This seems to fit. The scepter is a tool of power, and the religious figure adds legitimacy through ancestor spirits, which are often seen as divine or at least powerful in traditional societies.

So, considering the image shows a religious figure used in a political context (the scepter), the answer is likely D. The other options don't directly tie the image to the concept of using religious imagery for political legitimacy. The scepter is a political tool, and the religious figure is part of that tool to legitimize the ruler's power.

The image depicts an ivory scepter tip from Kongo, Western Africa, symbolizing a female ancestor spirit. This artifact illustrates how rulers often **legitimized their authority** through religious imagery. By incorporating ancestral spirits into political symbols, leaders reinforced their divine or spiritual authority, ensuring continuity in their rule. 

**Analysis of options:**
- **A** focuses on challenges to traditional elites, which isn’t directly addressed by the image.  
- **B** emphasizes state violence, unrelated to the scepter’s symbolic nature.  
- **C** generalizes royal patronage, but the image is a specific example, not a universal trend.  
- **D** aligns with the use of religious imagery to validate political power, as seen in the scepter’s design.  

**Answer:** D. Rulers used religious imagery to legitimize their political authority.
