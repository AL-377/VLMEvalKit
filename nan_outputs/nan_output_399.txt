Okay, let's try to figure out this question. The patient is a 25-year-old immigrant with fever and a several-month history of cord problems. The options are Trypanosomiasis, Amebic encephalitis, Cerebral malaria, Tuberculous meningitis, and Aspergillosis. 

First, the patient has been experiencing cord problems for several months. The cord is probably referring to the spinal cord, right? So the symptoms might be related to neurological issues. The patient is also an immigrant, which might mean they come from a region where certain diseases are endemic. Let me think about each option.

Trypanosomiasis: This is caused by Trypanosoma species, typically transmitted by the tsetse fly. It's more common in sub-Saharan Africa. The symptoms can include fever, neurological issues, and sometimes skin lesions. But the spinal cord problems might be part of the later stages. However, the patient is 25, which is a bit younger than typical for African trypanosomiasis. Also, the duration of several months is possible, but I'm not sure if it's the most likely.

Amebic encephalitis: This is caused by Naegleria fowleri or Acanthamoeba. It's usually associated with water exposure, like swimming in warm freshwater. Symptoms include fever, headache, confusion, and seizures. The spinal cord problems might be due to spread from the brain, but the history of several months seems longer than typical for amebic encephalitis. Also, the patient is an immigrant, but amebic encephalitis is more common in certain regions.

Cerebral malaria: This is caused by Plasmodium falciparum. Symptoms include fever, seizures, coma, and neurological deficits. It's common in malaria-endemic areas. The spinal cord issues could be part of the neurological presentation. However, cerebral malaria usually presents more acutely, often within days of infection. The several-month history might be atypical, but it's possible if the patient had chronic malaria. However, the patient is an immigrant, so maybe they have a history of malaria before.

Tuberculous meningitis: This is caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis. Symptoms include fever, headache, neck stiffness, and neurological deficits. It's more common in immunocompromised individuals, but can occur in anyone. The duration of several months might be due to chronic infection. However, the spinal cord problems could be from the meningeal inflammation affecting the spinal cord. This seems plausible. Tuberculosis is more common in certain regions, but the patient is an immigrant, so maybe they have a background of TB exposure.

Aspergillosis: This is a fungal infection, usually Aspergillus fumigatus. It can cause invasive aspergillosis, especially in immunocompromised patients. Symptoms include fever, cough, chest pain, and neurological issues. The spinal cord problems might be due to direct invasion or compression. However, the duration of several months is longer than typical for invasive aspergillosis, which usually presents more acutely. Also, the patient is an immigrant, but aspergillosis can occur in immunocompromised individuals regardless of origin.

Now, considering the options, the most likely is Tuberculous meningitis (D). The several-month history could be due to chronic infection, and the spinal cord problems might be from the meningeal inflammation affecting the spinal cord. The patient is an immigrant, but TB is endemic in many regions. Cerebral malaria (C) is possible, but the duration is longer than typical. Trypanosomiasis (A) is possible but less common in a 25-year-old. Amebic encephalitis (B) is less likely due to the duration. Aspergillosis (E) is possible but less common in an immunocompromised patient unless there's a specific risk factor.

So, the answer is D.
</think>

The patient's history of several months of spinal cord problems and fever, combined with being an immigrant, points to a chronic neurological infection. Tuberculous meningitis (D) is a strong candidate due to its prolonged presentation and association with immunocompromised individuals. While cerebral malaria (C) can cause neurological deficits, its typical duration is acute. Trypanosomiasis (A) and amebic encephalitis (B) are less likely given the chronicity. Aspergillosis (E) is possible but less common in an immunocompromised patient without specific risk factors. 

**Answer:** D. Tuberculous meningitis
