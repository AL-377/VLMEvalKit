Okay, so I need to calculate the average atomic mass of magnesium based on the given isotopes and their abundances. Let me start by recalling what average atomic mass is. From what I remember, it's the weighted average of the masses of all the naturally occurring isotopes of an element, taking into account their relative abundances. So, each isotope's mass is multiplied by its abundance percentage, and then all those values are added up. That should give the average atomic mass.

Looking at the table provided, there are three isotopes of magnesium: Mg-24, Mg-25, and Mg-26. Their masses are 24.0 amu, 25.0 amu, and 26.0 amu respectively. Their percent abundances are 79.0%, 10.0%, and 11.0%. 

First, I need to make sure the percentages add up to 100%. Let me check: 79.0 + 10.0 + 11.0 = 100.0%. That's good because that means the abundances are correctly given. No need to adjust anything here.

Now, the next step is to convert the percentages into decimal form for the calculations. So, 79.0% becomes 0.79, 10.0% becomes 0.10, and 11.0% becomes 0.11. 

Then, for each isotope, I multiply the mass by the decimal abundance. Let's do that one by one.

Starting with Mg-24: 24.0 amu * 0.79. Let me compute that. 24 * 0.79. Hmm, 24 * 0.7 is 16.8, and 24 * 0.09 is 2.16. Adding those together gives 16.8 + 2.16 = 18.96. So, Mg-24 contributes 18.96 amu.

Next, Mg-25: 25.0 amu * 0.10. That's straightforward. 25 * 0.1 = 2.5. So, Mg-25 contributes 2.5 amu.

Then, Mg-26: 26.0 amu * 0.11. Let me calculate that. 26 * 0.11. 26 * 0.1 is 2.6, and 26 * 0.01 is 0.26. Adding those gives 2.6 + 0.26 = 2.86. So, Mg-26 contributes 2.86 amu.

Now, I need to add all these contributions together to get the average atomic mass. Let's add them step by step.

First, 18.96 amu (Mg-24) + 2.5 amu (Mg-25) = 21.46 amu.

Then, add the Mg-26 contribution: 21.46 amu + 2.86 amu = 24.32 amu.

Wait, let me check that addition again to make sure I didn't make a mistake. 18.96 + 2.5 is indeed 21.46. Then 21.46 + 2.86. Let's break that down: 21 + 2 = 23, 0.46 + 0.86 = 1.32. So total is 23 + 1.32 = 24.32. Yes, that's correct.

So, the average atomic mass of magnesium is 24.32 amu. Let me just verify once more to ensure I didn't mix up any numbers or percentages.

Mg-24: 24.0 * 0.79 = 18.96. Correct.

Mg-25: 25.0 * 0.10 = 2.5. Correct.

Mg-26: 26.0 * 0.11 = 2.86. Correct.

Total: 18.96 + 2.5 = 21.46; 21.46 + 2.86 = 24.32. Yes, that seems right.

I think that's the correct calculation. The answer should be 24.32 amu.

The average atomic mass of magnesium is calculated by multiplying each isotope's mass by its abundance percentage (converted to decimal) and summing the results:

\[
\text{Average atomic mass} = (24.0 \, \text{amu} \times 0.79) + (25.0 \, \text{amu} \times 0.10) + (26.0 \, \text{amu} \times 0.11)
\]
\[
= 18.96 \, \text{amu} + 2.5 \, \text{amu} + 2.86 \, \text{amu} = 24.32 \, \text{amu}
\]

**Answer:** 24.32
