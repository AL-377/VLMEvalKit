Okay, so I need to figure out if all four samples are the same compound based on the graph provided. Let me start by recalling what a compound is. A compound is a substance composed of two or more different types of atoms chemically bonded together. The key here is that the ratio of the masses of the elements in a compound is constant, right? So if all four samples are the same compound, their mass ratios of iron to oxygen should be the same.

Looking at the graph, the x-axis represents the mass of oxygen (g), and the y-axis represents the mass of iron (g). Each point on the graph corresponds to a sample. Let me check the coordinates of each point. 

First point: oxygen is 2g, iron is 5g. So the ratio of iron to oxygen here is 5:2. 

Second point: oxygen is 4g, iron is 9g. The ratio here is 9:4. 

Third point: oxygen is 6g, iron is 15g. The ratio is 15:6, which simplifies to 5:2. 

Fourth point: oxygen is 8g, iron is 17g. The ratio here is 17:8. 

Wait, so the first and third samples have a ratio of 5:2, but the second and fourth have different ratios. That suggests that the compounds in the second and fourth samples are different. Because if they were the same compound, all the ratios should be the same. 

But let me double-check my calculations. For the second sample: 9g iron over 4g oxygen is 9/4 = 2.25. For the fourth sample: 17g iron over 8g oxygen is 17/8 = 2.125. These are different, so the ratios aren't the same. Therefore, the compounds in the second and fourth samples are different. 

But what about the first and third samples? They both have a ratio of 5:2, which is 2.5. So if the first and third samples are the same compound, then the second and fourth must be different. However, the question is asking if all four samples are the same compound. Since the second and fourth have different ratios, they can't be the same compound. Therefore, the answer should be B. False.

But wait, maybe I made a mistake in interpreting the graph. Let me check again. The graph is a line graph connecting the four points. The line seems to have a constant slope, which would imply a constant ratio. But the points themselves have different ratios. So even though the line is straight, the individual points have different ratios. Therefore, the conclusion is that the compounds are not the same. 

Alternatively, maybe the question is tricking me. Let me think. If the line is straight, does that mean the ratio is constant? Yes, a straight line on a graph with mass on both axes would imply a constant ratio. But in this case, the points on the line have different ratios. For example, the first point is 5g iron and 2g oxygen (ratio 2.5), the third point is 15g iron and 6g oxygen (ratio 2.5). The second and fourth points have different ratios. So even though the line is straight, the individual data points have different ratios. Therefore, the compounds are not the same. 

Therefore, the correct answer is B. False.

The graph shows four data points with varying ratios of iron to oxygen:  
- Sample 1: 5g Fe / 2g O (ratio 2.5)  
- Sample 2: 9g Fe / 4g O (ratio 2.25)  
- Sample 3: 15g Fe / 6g O (ratio 2.5)  
- Sample 4: 17g Fe / 8g O (ratio 2.125)  

Since the ratios differ between samples 2 and 4, the compounds are not identical. A constant ratio is required for the same compound.  

**Answer:** B. False
