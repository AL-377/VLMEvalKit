Okay, so I need to figure out which period this artwork belongs to based on its style. The options are Gothic, Romanesque, Early Medieval, or Northern Renaissance. Let me start by looking at the image provided. 

First, the image shows a relief sculpture with a central figure that seems to be a religious icon, possibly Jesus or a saint, given the halo and the way the figures are arranged. The central figure is surrounded by smaller figures, which might represent angels or other heavenly beings. The style of the figures is quite detailed, with intricate drapery and detailed carvings on the clothing. 

Looking at the overall composition, the central figure is elevated, which is common in religious art to emphasize their importance. The figures are arranged in a tiered manner, which might be part of a tympanum or a similar architectural feature. The use of relief, where the figures are carved into the stone but still have some depth, is typical of Romanesque art. 

Now, let's consider the options. Gothic art is known for its pointed arches, ribbed vaults, and intricate tracery, which are more architectural than sculptural. The figures in Gothic art are often more elongated and have flowing drapery, but the relief here seems more three-dimensional. 

Romanesque art, on the other hand, is characterized by rounded arches, thick walls, and sturdy columns. The sculptures from this period often have a more robust and simplified style, with less emphasis on perspective and more on mass and form. The figures here might have a bit of that, but the detailed drapery and the central figure's prominence could also be Romanesque. 

Early Medieval art, which includes the Byzantine period, tends to have more stylized figures, often with abstracted features and a focus on iconography. The figures in this image seem more realistic and three-dimensional, so that might not fit as well. 

Northern Renaissance art, which includes the High Renaissance, would have more naturalistic figures, perspective, and a focus on humanism. The figures here don't seem to have the same level of realism or the complex anatomical details that you'd see in later Renaissance works. 

Putting this all together, the style of the relief with its detailed drapery, central figure, and tiered composition is more characteristic of Romanesque art. The use of relief and the emphasis on the central figure are typical of Romanesque tympanums, which often depict religious scenes. The Early Medieval style is more abstract, and the Northern Renaissance is too late. Gothic is more architectural and less about relief sculpture. So I think the answer is B. Romanesque.

The artwork in question is a relief sculpture with a central figure, likely a religious icon, surrounded by smaller figures. The detailed drapery, tiered composition, and emphasis on the central figure are hallmarks of Romanesque art. This style, prevalent in the 11th to 13th centuries, often featured religious scenes in tympanums with robust, simplified figures. Gothic art, while also religious, prioritizes pointed arches and intricate tracery, which are absent here. Early Medieval (Byzantine) art is more abstract, and Northern Renaissance art emphasizes realism and humanism, both of which are not evident in this piece. 

**Answer:** B. Romanesque
