Okay, let's see. The question is asking which option correctly identifies what Father Time is a symbol of. The options are A. Time waits for no man, B. A common experience, C. A mystery, D. A clock.

First, I need to recall what Father Time typically represents. From what I remember, Father Time is often depicted as an old man holding a scythe and a clock. The scythe symbolizes death, and the clock represents time. So, the combination of these two elements usually signifies the concept that time is无情 and doesn't spare anyone, even the dead. That's the phrase "time waits for no man," which means time moves forward regardless of what happens.

Looking at the options, A is "Time waits for no man," which seems to fit. The other options don't seem to make as much sense. B is "A common experience," which is too vague. C is "A mystery," which doesn't align with the symbolism. D is "A clock," but Father Time isn't just a clock; he's a personification of time itself, combining both time and death. So the clock is part of the symbol, but the full meaning is more about the inevitability of time passing.

Therefore, the correct answer should be A.

Father Time, depicted with a scythe (symbolizing death) and a clock (representing time), embodies the idea that time is relentless and does not spare anyone. This aligns with the phrase **"Time waits for no man"** (Option A). The other options are less precise: "A common experience" (B) is too vague, "A mystery" (C) doesn’t capture the symbolic meaning, and "A clock" (D) is only part of the imagery, not the full concept. 

**Answer:** A. Time waits for no man
