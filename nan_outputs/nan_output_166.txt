Okay, let's see. The question is asking what the work in the image is. The options are an icon, a book cover, an altarpiece, or a purse lid. 

First, I need to analyze the image. The object is ornate, with a lot of gold, jewels, and intricate designs. The central figure looks like a crucifixion scene, with a person on the cross. There are cherubs or angels around, which is common in religious art. The text in the middle says "HIC EST REX IV DEORUM," which translates to "Here is the King of the Gods," referring to Jesus Christ. 

Now, considering the options. An icon is typically a religious image, often used in Eastern Orthodox Christianity. They are usually flat, painted on wood, and sometimes decorated with gold and jewels. The image here has a three-dimensional aspect, with the crucifixion figure in relief, which is more characteristic of an altarpiece. 

An altarpiece is a panel or structure used in a church, often above an altar, to hold religious paintings or sculptures. It's usually a freestanding piece or attached to the wall. The one in the image seems to be a freestanding piece, possibly a portable altarpiece, which would make sense for an altarpiece. 

A book cover would be flat and cover a book. The image is too detailed and three-dimensional to be a book cover. A purse lid is also flat and smaller, which doesn't match the size and complexity here. 

So, the central figure is a crucifixion, which is a common subject in altarpieces. The ornate decoration and the text reinforce that it's a religious artifact. The size and style also align with altarpieces, which are meant to be displayed prominently in churches. 

Therefore, the correct answer should be C. an altarpiece.

The image depicts a highly ornate, three-dimensional work with a crucifixion scene, cherubs, and religious text. The central figure and intricate design align with the style of an altarpiece, which is typically a freestanding religious panel or structure in churches. While icons are religious images, they are usually flat and painted on wood. The size, complexity, and crucifixion motif strongly indicate it is an altarpiece. 

**Answer:** C. an altarpiece
