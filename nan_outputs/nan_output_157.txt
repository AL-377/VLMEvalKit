Okay, so I need to figure out which contemporary artist's architectural style is resembled in this painting's setting. The options are Amolfo di Cambio, Brunelleschi, Bernini, and Michelangelo. Let me start by analyzing the image.

First, the painting shows a crucifixion scene. The setting is a large, domed structure with columns and arches. The architecture looks quite classical, with a high ceiling and a central dome. The use of perspective here is important. In the Renaissance, artists like Brunelleschi were known for their innovative use of linear perspective, which creates a sense of depth and three-dimensionality. 

Looking at the structure, the columns are tall and slender, which is typical of classical architecture. The arches are also a common feature in Renaissance buildings. The overall composition seems to follow the principles of Renaissance art, which often incorporated mathematical proportions and perspective to create a realistic illusion of space.

Now, let me think about the options. Amolfo di Cambio was an Italian sculptor and architect from the 13th century, so he's from the Gothic period. His work might have more ornate details and less focus on perspective. The architecture in this painting doesn't seem overly ornate, and the perspective is quite advanced, so Amolfo di Cambio is probably not the answer.

Brunelleschi, on the other hand, was a key figure in the Renaissance, famous for designing the dome of the Florence Cathedral. His architectural style emphasized proportion, symmetry, and the use of classical orders (like columns and arches). The structure in the painting has a dome, which is a hallmark of Brunelleschi's work. The columns and arches also align with his architectural principles. The use of linear perspective to create depth in the painting's setting is another characteristic of the Renaissance, which Brunelleschi contributed to.

Bernini and Michelangelo are both from the Baroque period, which came after the Renaissance. Baroque architecture is known for its dramatic use of light and shadow, curved lines, and dynamic movement. The painting here doesn't seem to have those elements. Instead, it's more static and structured, which aligns more with Renaissance ideals.

So, putting it all together, the architectural style in the painting's setting, with its dome, columns, arches, and perspective, is most consistent with Brunelleschi's work. Therefore, the answer should be option B.

The painting's setting features a dome, columns, arches, and a structured perspective, hallmarks of **Brunelleschi's** architectural style. His innovations in linear perspective and classical proportions are evident, aligning with the Renaissance principles depicted. 

**Answer:** B. Brunelleschi
