Okay, let's see. The question is about the result of the rise of empires shown in the map. The map has four territories: Spanish, Portuguese, British, and French. The options are A, B, C, D. I need to figure out which one best describes the result of these empires.

First, I should look at the map. The territories are spread across North and South America. The Spanish have a large chunk in the center, which might be the Spanish Empire. The Portuguese have a smaller area, possibly Brazil. The British and French are in the northern parts. So, this seems to be the New World, with European powers colonizing different regions.

Now, the options. Let's go through them one by one.

Option A: Joint-stock companies developed in order to monopolize all trade in the region. Hmm. Joint-stock companies were indeed used by European powers to finance their colonies. They allowed investors to pool money, and the company would have exclusive rights to trade in certain areas. For example, the Dutch East India Company was a joint-stock company that monopolized trade in Asia. But does this option say "monopolize all trade in the region"? That seems too broad. The map shows different empires, but the question is about the result of their rise. Maybe joint-stock companies were part of their strategies, but does the map directly show that? The map just shows territorial control, not the methods used to control trade. So maybe A is not the best answer.

Option B: Colonists exported manufactured goods to Europe. Wait, in the 17th and 18th centuries, the colonies were primarily producing raw materials for Europe, like tobacco, sugar, cotton, etc. They didn't produce manufactured goods. So this seems incorrect. Colonists were producers of raw materials, not exporters of manufactured goods. So B is probably wrong.

Option C: Mercantilist policies were used to expand European economies. Mercantilism was a system where countries tried to accumulate wealth by exporting more than they imported. They controlled trade through regulations and monopolies. This would explain why European powers established colonies to control resources and markets. The rise of empires would lead to the implementation of mercantilist policies to maximize profits and control trade. So this seems plausible. The map shows territorial control, which is a result of mercantilist policies. So C might be the answer.

Option D: Trans-Atlantic trade increased as trade networks in the Indian Ocean basin declined. Well, the Indian Ocean trade was already in decline by the 16th century due to the rise of European powers. The decline of Indian Ocean trade would mean that Europe was looking for new trade routes, which led to the colonization of the Americas. So trans-Atlantic trade increased as a result. But does the map show that? The map shows territorial control, but the question is about the result of the rise of empires. The decline of Indian Ocean trade was a cause of the rise of empires, not a result. So D might not be the best answer.

So, between C and A. The map shows territorial control, which is a result of mercantilist policies. Joint-stock companies were part of the means, but the result would be territorial expansion. So C seems more accurate. The rise of empires led to the implementation of mercantilist policies to expand their economies through colonies and trade control. Therefore, the answer is C.

The map illustrates the territorial expansion of European empires in the Americas, a direct result of **mercantilist policies**. These policies aimed to maximize wealth by controlling trade, resources, and markets, leading to the establishment of colonies and monopolies. While options A and D involve related concepts (joint-stock companies and trans-Atlantic trade), they focus on methods or causes rather than the outcome of imperial rise. Option B is incorrect, as colonies primarily exported raw materials, not manufactured goods. Thus, the best answer is:

**C. Mercantilist policies were used to expand European economies.**
