Okay, let's try to figure out this question. The question is about the Alexander Mosaic and how using over one million small tiles allowed its creator to do something. The options are A to D. Let me think about each option.

First, the Alexander Mosaic is a famous Roman mosaic from the 1st century BC, depicting the Battle of Issus between Alexander the Great and Darius III. It's known for its intricate detail and the use of small tiles, called tesserae. The question is about why using so many small tiles was beneficial.

Option A says it allowed the creator to depict a disorganized scene that overwhelms the viewer. Hmm, the mosaic shows a chaotic battle with lots of figures, but does that mean it's disorganized? Maybe, but I'm not sure if that's the main point. The use of small tiles might help in creating such detail, but does it specifically make the scene overwhelming? Maybe, but maybe that's a stretch.

Option B is about modeling the anatomy of the figures naturally. Using small tiles could allow for precise details in the human figures, like muscles and skin texture. Since each tile is small, the artist could use different colored tiles to create shading and depth, making the figures look more realistic. That seems plausible.

Option C is about modifying and transporting the composition easily. If the mosaic is made with small tiles, maybe it's easier to move or modify parts of it. But I don't think that's the main reason. The primary purpose of using small tiles is for artistic effect, not practical transportability.

Option D is reducing the figures into abstract forms. That doesn't seem right. The mosaic is highly detailed, so the figures are not abstract. They are depicted with realistic anatomy and movement.

So, considering the options, the most likely answer is B. The use of small tiles would allow for naturalistic modeling of anatomy. The mosaic's detail in the soldiers' muscles and expressions is a hallmark of the technique. The other options don't directly relate to the technical aspect of using small tiles for artistic effect.

The Alexander Mosaic's use of over one million small tiles enabled the creator to achieve **naturalistic anatomical modeling** (Option B). By employing tiny tesserae, the artist could intricately depict muscle definition, skin texture, and realistic human movement, capturing the chaos and detail of the battle scene. While the mosaic's complexity might overwhelm a viewer (Option A), the primary advantage lies in the technical precision of small-scale artistry. Options C (transportability) and D (abstraction) are less relevant to the artistic intent here. 

**Answer:** B. model the anatomy of the figures naturalistically
