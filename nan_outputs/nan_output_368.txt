Okay, so I need to figure out the time period when this icon was painted. The options are from the first/second century, sixth/seventh, tenth/eleventh, or fourteenth/fifteenth centuries. Let me start by looking at the image.

First, the icon has a central figure, presumably the Virgin Mary holding the Christ Child, which is a common theme in Christian art. The figures are depicted with halos, which is typical of religious art. The style of the clothing and the iconography might give clues.

Looking at the figures on either side of Mary. The one on the left is wearing a long robe with a cross on the chest, which might be a saint or a bishop. The one on the right is dressed in a red robe with a cross on the chest as well. Both have halos, so they are likely saints or holy figures. The background has two more figures above them, also with halos, possibly angels or other saints.

The clothing style seems to be Byzantine, which was prominent from the 4th to the 15th centuries. The use of gold leaf and the icon's style of representation, with the figures in profile and the use of gold halos, is characteristic of Byzantine art. The icon itself is on a wooden panel, which was common in Byzantine iconography.

Now, considering the options. The first two centuries (A) are too early for Byzantine art, which didn't really develop until the 4th century. The sixth or seventh century (B) is possible, but Byzantine art really flourished in the 9th century with the Iconoclasm period. The tenth or eleventh century (C) is a period when Byzantine art was still in full swing, with the use of gold and intricate details. The fourteenth or fifteenth century (D) is later, but the style here seems more classical than the later Byzantine which became more simplified.

The icon's style doesn't show the later Byzantine features like the "Palaiologan" style, which is more simplified and less ornate. Instead, it seems more classical, with detailed drapery and a more realistic representation of the figures. The halos are large and gold, which was a common feature in Byzantine icons. The figures are depicted in a way that's more classical, perhaps even with some Hellenistic influences.

Given that the options are between the sixth/seventh and tenth/eleventh centuries, and considering the style, I think the icon is more likely from the tenth or eleventh century. The use of gold leaf, the detailed clothing, and the classical style align with the later Byzantine period. The earlier periods (sixth/seventh) might have simpler halos and less ornate clothing. The later periods (fourteenth/fifteenth) are more simplified, so this doesn't fit. Therefore, the answer is probably C, tenth or eleventh century.

The icon's artistic style, characterized by gold leaf halos, detailed Byzantine clothing, and classical representation of figures, aligns with the later Byzantine period. The use of intricate drapery and ornate halos, combined with the absence of later simplification, suggests it was painted during the **tenth or eleventh century C.E.** 

**Answer:** C. tenth or eleventh century C.E.
