Okay, so I need to figure out who the patron was of the building shown in these two images. Let me start by looking at the options given: Abd al-Malik, Justinian, Charlemagne, and Shah Jahan. 

First, I should analyze the architectural features of the building. The first image is a floor plan, and the second is an interior view. The floor plan has a central dome, which is a key feature of Byzantine architecture. The interior has a large dome with intricate decorations, arched windows, and a central nave. The use of mosaics and the overall design suggest it's a religious building, likely a church or cathedral.

Now, considering the options. Abd al-Malik was a Umayyad caliph who ruled from 705 to 705, but I don't recall him being associated with any major architectural projects. Maybe the Dome of the Rock? But that's usually attributed to the Umayyads. 

Justinian was the Byzantine emperor who commissioned the construction of Hagia Sophia in Constantinople. The Hagia Sophia is known for its massive dome and is a prime example of Byzantine architecture. The interior design with the dome, the use of mosaics, and the overall structure match what I know about Hagia Sophia. 

Charlemagne was the Frankish king who established the Holy Roman Empire. He commissioned the construction of the Aachen Cathedral, which is a Carolingian-style building. While it's a significant work, the architectural style and features here don't align with Aachen's design. 

Shah Jahan was the Mughal emperor who built the Taj Mahal. The Taj Mahal is a mausoleum with intricate Islamic architecture, but again, the style here is more Byzantine, with domes and mosaics. 

So, putting it all together, the building in the images is Hagia Sophia, which was commissioned by Justinian. The architectural elements, especially the central dome and the use of mosaics, are hallmarks of Byzantine art and architecture during Justinian's reign. Therefore, the patron must be Justinian.

The building depicted in the images is Hagia Sophia, a renowned Byzantine structure. Its architectural features, including the central dome, intricate mosaics, and arched design, are characteristic of Byzantine art and engineering. Commissioned by Emperor Justinian I, Hagia Sophia exemplifies his vision for grandeur and innovation. 

**Answer:** B. Justinian
