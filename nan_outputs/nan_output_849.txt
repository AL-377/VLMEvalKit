Okay, let's see. The question is asking whether the note shown is the supertonic in Gb major. Hmm. First, I need to recall what the supertonic is. In music theory, the supertonic is the second degree of a major scale. So, in the key of Gb major, the notes would be Gb, Ab, Bb, C, Db, Eb, F, and then back to Gb. Let me list them out step by step.

Starting with Gb as the tonic. Then the first degree is Gb, second is Ab, third is Bb, fourth is C, fifth is Db, sixth is Eb, seventh is F, and the octave is Gb again. So the supertonic should be the second note after the tonic, which is Ab. 

Now, looking at the note in the image. The clef is a treble clef, and the note is on the second line of the staff. Let me count the lines. The lines from bottom to top are G, A, B, C, D. So the second line is B. Wait, but in the treble clef, the lines correspond to E, G, B, D, F. So the second line is B. But the note here is on the second line, which is B. But in the key of Gb major, the supertonic is Ab. So if the note is B, that's not Ab. Therefore, the answer should be False.

Wait, but let me double-check. Maybe I made a mistake in the key signature. Gb major has a flat for G, B, E, A, D, G. So the key signature is Gb, Ab, Bb, C, Db, Eb, F. So the notes are Gb, Ab, Bb, C, Db, Eb, F. So the second note is Ab. The note in the image is B, which is a different note. So yes, the supertonic is Ab, not B. Therefore, the statement is false. So the answer is B. False.

The supertonic in G♭ major is the second note of the scale, which is **Ab**. The note shown in the image is **B**, which is not part of the G♭ major scale. Therefore, the statement is **False**.

**Answer:** B. False
