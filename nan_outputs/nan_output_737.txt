Okay, let's see. The question is asking whether only one phase boundary is depicted in the image. The options are A. true or B. false. 

First, I need to understand what a phase boundary is. From what I remember, in materials science, a phase boundary is the interface between two different phases, like a solid and a liquid or two different solid phases. So, if the image shows such an interface, then there's a phase boundary. 

Looking at the image, there are two distinct regions: one with green circles and another with gray circles. The green circles are arranged in a hexagonal pattern, which is typical for a crystal structure, maybe a hexagonal close-packed structure. The gray circles are also in a hexagonal pattern but seem to be a different phase. The black dots might be defects or impurities. 

Now, the question is whether there's only one phase boundary. Let me visualize the image. The green and gray regions are adjacent to each other, but there's a clear boundary between them. However, the question mentions "only one phase boundary." But wait, sometimes in materials, there can be multiple phase boundaries if there are multiple interfaces. For example, in a composite material, you might have different phase boundaries. 

But in this case, the image shows two different phases: green and gray. The boundary between them is a single line, right? So, if there's only one such boundary, then the answer would be true. But wait, maybe there's another boundary that's not visible? For example, if the green and gray regions are part of a larger structure with other phases. But the image is only showing a portion. 

Alternatively, maybe the green and gray regions are actually the same phase with different orientations or something else. But the hexagonal patterns are different, so they must be different phases. 

Wait, but the question says "only one phase boundary is depicted." If the image is only showing a single boundary between two phases, then the answer is true. But if there are other phase boundaries in the image that aren't mentioned, then it's false. 

Looking closely at the image, the green and gray regions are adjacent, but there's no indication of other phase boundaries. The black dots are just defects. So, if the only phase boundary is between green and gray, then the answer is true. 

But wait, sometimes phase boundaries can be more complex. For example, in a polycrystalline material, there are grain boundaries between different grains. But in this case, the image is showing two different phases, not grains. So, the phase boundary is between the two phases. 

Therefore, since there's only one phase boundary between the green and gray regions, the answer should be A. true. 

But wait, let me double-check. The image is a 2D representation. Maybe the phase boundary is not a single line but a more complex structure? But in 2D, a phase boundary would typically be a line. If it's a single line, then yes, only one. If there are multiple lines, then it's more than one. 

Looking at the image, the green and gray regions are adjacent, but there's no indication of other regions. The black dots are just points, not indicating another phase. So, I think the answer is A. true.

The image depicts two distinct phases: green and gray, separated by a clear boundary. Since only one phase boundary is shown between these two regions, the statement is true. 

**Answer:** A. true
