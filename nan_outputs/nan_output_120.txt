Okay, let's see. The question is asking who created the painting shown here. The options are A. Arkhip Kuinni, B. Paul Signac, C. Georges Seurat, D. Valentin Serov. Hmm. First, I need to recall what I know about these artists and their styles.

Starting with the painting itself. It looks like a pointillist work. Pointillism is a technique where small, distinct dots of color are applied in patterns to form an image. The brushstrokes are very small and precise, creating a textured surface. The colors are bright and the composition seems to have a lot of light, maybe a coastal scene with cliffs and the sea. The horizon is low, and there are some boats visible in the distance.

Now, let's think about each artist. Arkhip Kuinni was a Russian painter, right? He was known for his landscapes and seascapes, but I think his style was more impressionistic. He might have used broader strokes rather than the tiny dots. So probably not A.

Paul Signac was a French painter who was part of the Neo-Impressionist movement. He worked with pointillism, using dots of color to create images. His works often have a calm, harmonious feel, and he was known for his seascapes. The painting here seems to fit that style. So maybe B is a candidate.

Georges Seurat was another French artist, famous for his pointillist technique. He created large-scale works, like "A Sunday on La Grande Jatte." His style is similar to Signac's, but maybe with more geometric patterns. The painting here might be by Seurat, but I need to be careful. Let me think. Seurat's works are often more structured, with precise dots forming figures or landscapes. The cliff and sea here could be a coastal scene, which Seurat might have painted. But Signac also did similar subjects.

Valentin Serov was a Russian portrait painter. He worked in the 19th and early 20th centuries, and his portraits are quite different from the pointillist style. So D is probably not the answer.

So between B and C. Let me check more details. Paul Signac was a friend of Seurat and continued the pointillist movement after Seurat's death. He often painted coastal scenes, which this painting resembles. The use of dots and the overall composition seem to align with Signac's style. Seurat's works are more about structured patterns and figures, whereas this painting is more of a landscape. So I think the answer is B. Paul Signac.

The painting exhibits the hallmark characteristics of **pointillism**, a technique where small dots of color are applied to create an image. The coastal scene with cliffs, the low horizon, and the distant boats align with the style of **Paul Signac**, a French Neo-Impressionist artist known for his seascapes and use of this technique. While both Signac and Seurat were part of the same movement, Signac's works often featured more dynamic, harmonious compositions, matching the serene and structured appearance of this painting. 

**Answer:** B. PAUL SIGNAC
