Okay, let's try to figure out this question. The map shows a voyage path from Lisbon to Calicut, which is in India. The key points here are the starting point in Portugal (Lisbon) and ending in India. The options are about conclusions from the early sixteenth century based on this map.

First, let's look at each option.

Option A: Portugal was primarily interested in exploration of the African and Asian coasts. The map shows a route from Portugal to India, which is in Asia. So that makes sense. They were exploring the African coast (Cape Verde Islands) and then going to Asia. So this seems plausible.

Option B: Vasco de Gama was the first European to embark on intercontinental travel by sea. Well, Vasco de Gama did sail from Europe to India, which was an intercontinental journey. But the map here shows a route from Portugal to India, which might be part of that voyage. However, the question is about the early sixteenth century. Vasco de Gama was indeed the first to sail from Europe to India, but the map here is just showing a part of that journey. So maybe this is a bit of a stretch. The map itself doesn't necessarily prove he was the first. So maybe B is not directly supported by the map.

Option C: European nations began to look outward for economic opportunities. The map shows a trade route, which could imply that they were seeking economic opportunities. But the map itself doesn't explicitly state that it's for economic reasons. It's just a path of a voyage. So maybe C is possible, but it's a bit of an inference. The map shows a route, but the motivation isn't clear from the map alone.

Option D: European began mass migrations to distant lands in the early sixteenth century. Mass migrations would involve large numbers of people moving to new lands. The map shows a single voyage, not a migration. So D seems unlikely.

So, the most directly supported conclusion would be A. The map shows a route from Portugal to India, which is in Asia, so they were exploring both African and Asian coasts. The other options are either about specific individuals (B) or broader economic motivations (C) which aren't directly indicated by the map. D is about migration, which isn't shown here. So A seems the best answer.

The map illustrates a voyage from Lisbon to Calicut, India, highlighting exploration of both African and Asian coasts. This directly supports **A. Portugal was primarily interested in exploration of the African and Asian coasts**. While Vasco de Gama's intercontinental journey (option B) is implied, the map itself does not confirm his role as the first European. Options C and D are inferences not explicitly supported by the map. 

**Answer:** A. Portugal was primarily interested in exploration of the African and Asian coasts
