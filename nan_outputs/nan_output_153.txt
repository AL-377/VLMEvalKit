Okay, so I need to figure out who created this statue. The options are Bemini, Donatello, Ghiberti, and Verrocchio. Let me start by looking at the image. The statue is a bronze figure of a man, standing with one hand on his hip and the other holding a staff. He's wearing a hat and has a bird perched on his staff. The base has a turtle and a bird, maybe a dove or something else. 

Hmm, the style seems quite classical, with a focus on the human form. The proportions and the way the muscles are defined remind me of Renaissance art. Let me think about each option. 

Bemini... I'm not sure who that is. Maybe a typo? Bemini could be a misspelling of Bembo? Or maybe a different name. If it's a real artist, I don't recall their work. 

Donatello was a famous Italian Renaissance sculptor. He's known for his bronze David, which is similar in style to this statue. The David is a standing nude figure with a staff, and the base often includes a turtle and a bird. The pose and the details in the musculature match Donatello's work. 

Ghiberti is another Italian Renaissance artist, famous for the Gates of Paradise on the Baptistery in Florence. His sculptures are more ornate and detailed, but maybe not as muscular as this figure. 

Verrocchio was a student of Donatello and also a Renaissance sculptor. He worked on the David as well, but I think his style might be slightly different. The David by Verrocchio is also a bronze statue, but perhaps with more flowing drapery. 

Wait, the statue in the image has a very defined, almost anatomically correct body. The way the muscles are sculpted is quite realistic. Donatello's David is known for its realism and attention to detail. The base with the turtle and bird also matches the David's base. 

So, considering all that, I think the answer is B. Donatello. The other options don't fit as well. Bemini isn't a name I recognize in art history, Ghiberti's work is more decorative, and Verrocchio's David is different in style. Therefore, the correct answer should be B.

The statue depicted is a bronze figure of a man, standing with a staff and a turtle and bird on the base, characteristic of Renaissance art. The anatomical realism, muscular definition, and pose align with Donatello's style, particularly his famous bronze *David*. While Verrocchio and Ghiberti are also Renaissance artists, their works differ in style and detail. Bemini is not a recognized artist in this context. 

**Answer:** B. Donatello
