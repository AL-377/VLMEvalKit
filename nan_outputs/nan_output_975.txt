Okay, let's see. The question is asking how many complete sleep cycles can be seen in Figure 1. The options are A.7, B.5, C.4, D.6. Hmm. First, I need to recall what a sleep cycle looks like. From what I remember, a typical sleep cycle has four stages: N1, N2, N3, and REM. Each cycle usually takes about 90 minutes. So, if the graph shows the progression through these stages over time, each 90-minute block would be one cycle.

Looking at Figure 1, it's a hypnogram, which is a graph that tracks the stages of sleep throughout the night. The x-axis is hours of sleep, and the y-axis is the sleep stage. The bars represent different stages. The first bar is Awake, then there are several stages labeled A, B, C, D. Wait, maybe the stages are labeled A, B, C, D instead of N1, N2, N3, REM? Let me check the description given in the problem.

The problem mentions N1, N2, N3, and REM. So, the stages in the hypnogram should correspond to these. But in the figure, the stages are labeled A, B, C, D. Maybe the labels in the figure are different. Let me see. The first bar is Awake, then A, B, C, D. So, perhaps A is N1, B is N2, C is N3, and D is REM? That makes sense because the stages are N1, N2, N3, REM. So, the hypnogram is tracking the transitions between these stages.

Now, each cycle starts with N1, then N2, N3, and then REM. So, each cycle is 90 minutes. Let's count how many cycles fit into the 7 hours shown in the graph. The first cycle would start at hour 0 (Awake) and end at hour 1.2 (since 90 minutes is 1.5 hours, but maybe the graph is in whole hours? Wait, the x-axis is labeled in hours, but the bars might represent intervals. Let me think.

If the first cycle is from 0 to 1.5 hours (90 minutes), then each subsequent cycle would be 1.5 hours. So, starting at 0, then 1.5, 3, 4.5, 6, 7.5. But the graph only goes up to 7 hours. So, the cycles would be:

1. 0-1.5 hours (N1, N2, N3, REM)
2. 1.5-3 hours (N1, N2, N3, REM)
3. 3-4.5 hours (N1, N2, N3, REM)
4. 4.5-6 hours (N1, N2, N3, REM)
5. 6-7.5 hours (N1, N2, N3, REM)

But the graph only goes up to 7 hours. So, the fifth cycle would end at 6 hours, which is 4.5 hours into the cycle. Wait, but the problem says "as the night progresses, one spends more time in REM sleep, and less in N3." So, maybe the cycles aren't all the same length. But the question is about complete cycles. So, if a cycle is 90 minutes, then each cycle is 1.5 hours. So, from 0 to 1.5, 1.5 to 3, etc. So, how many complete cycles fit into 7 hours?

7 hours is 420 minutes. Each cycle is 90 minutes. 420 divided by 90 is 4.666... So, 4 full cycles (360 minutes) and 60 minutes left. But the last cycle would only be 60 minutes, which is less than a full cycle. Therefore, there are 4 complete cycles. So, the answer would be C.4.

Wait, but let me check again. If the first cycle is 0-1.5, then the next is 1.5-3, then 3-4.5, 4.5-6, 6-7.5. But the graph only goes up to 7 hours. So, the fifth cycle would end at 6 hours, which is 4.5 hours into the cycle. So, yes, 4 full cycles. So, the answer is C.4.

But wait, the options are A.7, B.5, C.4, D.6. So, the correct answer is C.4. But let me make sure I didn't misinterpret the stages. The problem mentions that the stages are N1, N2, N3, and REM. So, the hypnogram is tracking these stages. The first bar is Awake, then A, B, C, D. So, maybe A is N1, B is N2, C is N3, D is REM. So, each cycle is N1, N2, N3, REM. So, each cycle is 90 minutes. Therefore, 4 cycles in 7 hours. So, answer C.

The hypnogram in Figure 1 tracks sleep stages over 7 hours. Each sleep cycle consists of N1, N2, N3, and REM stages, lasting approximately 90 minutes (1.5 hours). The graph spans 7 hours, which is 420 minutes. Dividing 420 by 90 gives 4.666 cycles, indicating 4 complete cycles (360 minutes) and 60 minutes remaining. Thus, there are **4 complete sleep cycles**.

**Answer:** C. 4
