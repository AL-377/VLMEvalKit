Okay, let's see. The question is asking which of the options A, B, C, or D is a type of crime that plagues society. The options are Corporate crime, Violent crime, Victimless crime, and All of the above. The image shows crime scene tape, so the context is about criminal activity.

First, I need to understand each term. Corporate crime refers to illegal activities committed by businesses or organizations, like fraud or embezzlement. Violent crime involves physical harm, such as murder, assault, or robbery. Victimless crime is an act that's illegal but doesn't involve harm to others, like drug use or prostitution. 

Now, the question is whether these are types of crime that "plague" society. Plague here might mean are they major issues or widespread. Let's break down each option.

Corporate crime: While it's a significant issue, it's more about business ethics and legal violations rather than violent or victimless crimes. However, it's definitely a problem in society, especially in terms of economic and ethical issues.

Violent crime: This is a major societal issue. It includes crimes like murder, assault, and robbery, which directly harm individuals and communities. It's a significant problem that's been a concern for many years.

Victimless crime: These crimes don't involve physical harm but are still illegal. Examples include drug use, prostitution, and gambling. They can be controversial because they don't harm others, but they still cause societal issues like drug addiction, crime, and public health problems.

So, all three types (corporate, violent, victimless) are indeed types of crime that plague society. Corporate crime affects businesses and economies, violent crime directly harms individuals, and victimless crimes have broader societal impacts. Therefore, the answer should be D: All of the above.

The question asks which of the listed options is a type of crime that plagues society. Analyzing each term:

- **Corporate crime** involves illegal activities by businesses, such as fraud, which are significant societal issues but distinct from violent or victimless crimes.  
- **Violent crime** directly harms individuals and communities, making it a major societal problem.  
- **Victimless crime** includes illegal acts like drug use or prostitution, which have broader societal impacts (e.g., addiction, public health, and crime).  

All three categories (corporate, violent, and victimless crime) are indeed types of crime that plague society. Thus, the correct answer is:  

**D. All of the above**
