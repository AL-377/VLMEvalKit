Okay, so I need to figure out what happens to the light emitted when a hydrogen atom transitions from n=3 to n=1 instead of n=3 to n=2. The options are about frequency, wavelength, speed, and momentum. Let me start by recalling what I know about Bohr's model and atomic transitions.

First, in the Bohr model, electrons orbit the nucleus in specific energy levels, or shells, labeled by n. When an electron moves from a higher energy level to a lower one, it emits a photon. The energy of the photon is equal to the difference in energy between the two levels. The formula for the energy difference is E = -R*(1/n² - 1/m²), where R is the Rydberg constant. Here, R is approximately 13.6 eV.

So, if the electron goes from n=3 to n=2, the energy difference is E = -R*(1/4 - 1/9) = -R*(9/36 - 4/36) = -R*(5/36). That would correspond to a certain wavelength, which can be calculated using E = hc/λ, where h is Planck's constant and c is the speed of light. The wavelength λ would be hc/(E). Since E is negative, the wavelength would be positive, which makes sense.

Now, if the electron goes from n=3 to n=1, the energy difference would be E = -R*(1/9 - 1/1) = -R*(1/9 - 1) = -R*(-8/9) = 8R/9. That's a larger energy difference because the electron is moving from a higher energy level (n=3) to the ground state (n=1), which has the lowest energy. So, the photon emitted would have more energy, which means higher frequency and shorter wavelength.

Looking at the options:

A. lower frequency – If the energy is higher, frequency should be higher. So A is incorrect.

B. longer wavelength – Since higher energy corresponds to shorter wavelength, longer wavelength would mean lower energy. So B is incorrect.

C. greater speed – The speed of light is constant in a vacuum, so the speed of the photon shouldn't change. So C is incorrect.

D. greater momentum – Momentum is related to energy. Since the photon has more energy when transitioning from n=3 to n=1, its momentum would be greater. The momentum of a photon is given by p = h/λ, so higher energy (shorter λ) would mean higher momentum. Therefore, D is correct.

Wait, let me double-check. The momentum of a photon is indeed h/λ. Since the energy is higher when moving from n=3 to n=1, λ is shorter, so p is greater. So yes, D is correct. The other options are about frequency and wavelength, which are inversely related, so if one increases, the other decreases. But since the energy is higher, wavelength is shorter, frequency is higher. So A and B are wrong. Speed is always c, so C is wrong. Momentum is proportional to energy, so D is correct. Therefore, the answer should be D.

The transition from \( n = 3 \) to \( n = 1 \) in a hydrogen atom involves a larger energy difference compared to transitioning from \( n = 3 \) to \( n = 2 \). Since energy (\( E \)) is inversely proportional to wavelength (\( \lambda \)) (via \( E = \frac{hc}{\lambda} \)), a higher energy transition (shorter \( \lambda \)) results in a higher frequency. However, the speed of light (\( c \)) is constant for all photons, so option C is incorrect. Momentum (\( p = \frac{h}{\lambda} \)) is directly proportional to energy, meaning a higher energy transition (shorter \( \lambda \)) leads to greater momentum. 

**Answer:** D. greater momentum
