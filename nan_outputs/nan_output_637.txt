Okay, let's see. The question is about figuring out which term refers to words or phrases in a sentence that help the reader understand the meaning of an unknown word. The options are A. Inference, B. Message, C. Context Clue, D. Text Evidence.

First, I need to recall what each term means. Inference is when you draw a conclusion based on evidence, right? Like, if I see a dog barking, I might infer it's trying to get attention. But that's not directly about understanding a word. The question is about words in a sentence helping explain an unknown word. So maybe inference isn't the right answer here.

Message is the main idea or the point the author is trying to communicate. But again, the question is about how words in the sentence help with the meaning of an unknown word. So message might not be the right term either.

Context clue refers to using the surrounding words or phrases to figure out the meaning of a new word. For example, if a sentence says "The cat slept on the windowsill," and the word "windowsill" is new, you might use the context clues like "windows" and "sill" to figure out it's a part of a window. That sounds exactly like what the question is asking. So context clue is the term here.

Text evidence is when you use specific parts of the text to support an argument. That's more about supporting a claim rather than understanding a word's meaning. So that's probably not it either.

So putting it all together, the correct answer should be C. Context Clue. The magnifying glass in the image also suggests looking closely at the text, which aligns with using context clues to understand a word.
