Okay, let's see. The question is asking which term directly relates to the digital divide based on the given definition. The options are A. Digital divide, B. Knowledge gap, C. Feminist perspective, D. E-gap.

First, I need to recall what the digital divide refers to. From the image, it's defined as "the gap between people who have access to modern information and communications technology and those who don't." So the key here is the difference in access to technology and the resulting gap in knowledge or opportunities.

Now, looking at the options. Option A is the digital divide, which matches the definition given. Option B is the knowledge gap, which might be related but the question specifically mentions the digital divide. Option C is a feminist perspective, which seems unrelated to technology access. Option D is E-gap, which I'm not sure about. Maybe it's a variation of digital divide, but I think the standard term is digital divide.

Wait, the image shows two people, one with a computer and the other without, which visually represents the divide. The definition directly states the gap in access to technology leading to a gap in knowledge. So the correct answer should be A. Digital divide. The other options don't fit as well. The knowledge gap might be a part of it, but the question is about the term that can be directly attributed, which is the digital divide.

The digital divide directly refers to the gap between people with access to modern information and communications technology and those without. The term explicitly aligns with the provided definition. While the knowledge gap (B) and E-gap (D) may be related, they are not the primary term described. The feminist perspective (C) is unrelated. 

**Answer:** A. Digital divide
