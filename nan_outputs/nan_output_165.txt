Okay, so I need to figure out which artist painted this famous painting. Let me start by looking at the options: Angelica Kauffmann, Peter Paul Rubens, Thomas Gainsborough, and Benjamin West. The painting itself is quite dramatic, with a lot of people in the foreground and a battle scene in the background. The central figure is a man in a red coat lying on the ground, surrounded by others. There's also a Native American figure and a flag in the background. 

First, I remember that this painting is called "The Death of General Wolfe," which is a well-known work. I think it's associated with the Battle of Quebec during the French and Indian War. The artist Benjamin West is famous for this painting. Let me recall: Angelica Kauffmann was a Swiss painter known for portraits and landscapes, so probably not this one. Peter Paul Rubens was a Baroque painter, but I don't think he did this specific work. Thomas Gainsborough was an English painter, known for portraits and landscapes, so maybe not either. 

Wait, the painting's style seems to have a lot of emotion and movement, which is characteristic of Benjamin West. He was known for his dramatic historical paintings. The scene depicted here matches the Battle of Quebec, where General Wolfe died. The central figure in red is likely General Wolfe, lying mortally wounded. The Native American figure might be a Mohawk warrior, which aligns with the historical context. 

Another clue is the composition. The foreground with the injured figure and the people around him, the background with the battle, and the flag. The use of light and shadow, as well as the emotional intensity, are typical of Benjamin West's style. I think I've seen this painting before, and it's definitely attributed to him. So the answer should be D. Benjamin West.

The central figure in red and the Native American figure underscore the painting's historical context, while the emotional focus on General Wolfe's final moments solidifies its association with West.
