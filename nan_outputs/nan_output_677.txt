Okay, let's see. The question is asking for the month when the difference between the number of unemployed high school graduates and those without a high school diploma was the smallest. The options are June, July, August, September, October. 

First, I need to understand the graph. It's a line graph showing the number of unemployed workers (in thousands) over five months, categorized by education level: less than a high school diploma, high school diploma, no college, some college, and bachelor's degree and higher. Each category has a line representing the number of unemployed over the months. 

The key here is to find the month where the difference between two specific groups is the smallest. The two groups mentioned are "high school diploma, no college" and "less than a high school diploma." So, I need to look at these two lines and see in which month their values are closest to each other.

Let me label the lines for clarity. The top line is "Less than a high school diploma," the next one is "High school diploma, no college," then "Some college," and the bottom one is "Bachelor's degree and higher." 

To find the difference between the two middle lines (high school diploma and less than high school diploma), I need to compare their values for each month. The difference would be the absolute value of the difference between their numbers. The month with the smallest difference is the answer.

Looking at the graph:

- In June: The "Less than a high school diploma" line is at around 13 thousand, and the "High school diploma, no college" line is at around 8.5 thousand. The difference is 13 - 8.5 = 4.5 thousand.

- In July: Both lines seem to be slightly lower. "Less than a high school diploma" is around 12.5, and "High school diploma, no college" is around 8.75. Difference is 12.5 - 8.75 = 3.75 thousand.

- In August: "Less than a high school diploma" is around 12, and "High school diploma, no college" is around 8.5. Difference is 12 - 8.5 = 3.5 thousand.

- In September: "Less than a high school diploma" is around 11.5, and "High school diploma, no college" is around 8.25. Difference is 11.5 - 8.25 = 3.25 thousand.

- In October: "Less than a high school diploma" is around 12, and "High school diploma, no college" is around 8.5. Difference is 12 - 8.5 = 3.5 thousand.

Wait, hold on. Let me check the exact numbers again because the graph might have more precise values. For example, in August, the "Less than a high school diploma" line might be 12 thousand, and "High school diploma, no college" is 8.5 thousand. So the difference is 3.5 thousand. Then in September, "Less than a high school diploma" is 11.5, and "High school diploma, no college" is 8.25, difference 3.25. So September has the smallest difference of 3.25 thousand. Then October is 3.5 again. So the smallest difference is in September. Therefore, the answer should be D. September.

But let me double-check all months to make sure I didn't misread any numbers. June: 13 vs 8.5, difference 4.5. July: 12.5 vs 8.75, difference 3.75. August: 12 vs 8.5, difference 3.5. September: 11.5 vs 8.25, difference 3.25. October: 12 vs 8.5, difference 3.5. Yes, September is indeed the smallest. So the correct answer is D.
