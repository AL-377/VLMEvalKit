Okay, let's see. The question is about the vestibular system and possible effects from an infection or tumor pressing on the vestibulocochlear nerve. The options are decreased auditory acuity, vertigo, tinnitus, and loss of facial sensation. I need to figure out which one wouldn't occur.

First, I remember that the vestibulocochlear nerve (also called the eighth cranial nerve) has two parts: the vestibular division and the cochlear division. The vestibular part is responsible for balance, and the cochlear part is for hearing. So, if there's a problem with the vestibular part, symptoms related to balance would occur, like vertigo or dizziness. If the cochlear part is affected, hearing issues like decreased auditory acuity or tinnitus (ringing in the ears) would occur.

Now, the question is asking which of the options would NOT occur. So, the answer is the one that isn't related to either the vestibular or cochlear functions. Let's go through each option:

A. Decreased auditory acuity: This would be related to the cochlear division. If the cochlear nerve is damaged, hearing would be affected. So this should occur.

B. Vertigo: This is a vestibular symptom. If the vestibular nerve is compressed, the person would experience dizziness or vertigo. This should occur.

C. Tinnitus: Again, this is a cochlear symptom. If the cochlear nerve is damaged, the person might hear ringing or buzzing in the ears. This should occur.

D. Loss of facial sensation: Hmm, facial sensation is controlled by the facial nerve (VII cranial nerve), not the vestibulocochlear nerve. The vestibulocochlear nerve is only for balance and hearing. So loss of facial sensation would be unrelated to this nerve. Therefore, this shouldn't occur.

So the answer should be D. Loss of facial sensation. Let me double-check. The vestibulocochlear nerve is specifically for hearing and balance. The facial nerve is for facial muscles and taste. So yes, loss of facial sensation isn't related here. The other options are all related to the vestibulocochlear nerve's functions. Therefore, D is the correct answer.

The vestibulocochlear nerve (VIII cranial nerve) has two divisions: vestibular (balance) and cochlear (hearing). A tumor pressing on this nerve would affect either balance or hearing, but not facial sensation. 

- **A. Decreased auditory acuity** (cochlear division) and **C. Tinnitus** (cochlear division) are both possible.  
- **B. Vertigo** (vestibular division) is also a vestibular symptom.  
- **D. Loss of facial sensation** is unrelated to the vestibulocochlear nerve, as it is controlled by the facial nerve (VII cranial nerve).  

**Answer:** D. Loss of facial sensation.
