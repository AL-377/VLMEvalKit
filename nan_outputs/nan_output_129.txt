Okay, so I need to figure out which artist painted this portrait of William Hunter, the founder of the Hunterian. The options are Reynolds, Raeburn, Romney, or Ramsay. Let me start by recalling what I know about each of these artists and their styles.

First, Sir Joshua Reynolds was a prominent painter in the late 18th century, known for his portraits and his role as the president of the Royal Academy. He was associated with the Neo-classical style, which often emphasized classical themes and idealized figures. His portraits are usually formal and composed, with a focus on the sitter's expression and attire.

Sir Henry Raeburn was a Scottish portrait painter active in the late 18th and early 19th centuries. He's known for his portraits of the Scottish elite, particularly in Edinburgh. Raeburn's style is more naturalistic and he often captured the sitter's personality through subtle details in the face and expression. His portraits are quite lifelike and sometimes have a sense of movement.

George Romney was another English portrait painter, but he was more associated with the late 18th century. He's known for his portraits of women, often capturing their beauty and elegance. His style is more romantic and idealized, with soft lighting and flowing drapery. He might be more likely to paint women in flowing dresses, so maybe not the best fit here.

Allan Ramsay was a Scottish portrait painter who worked in the 18th century. He's known for his portraits of the Scottish nobility and his ability to capture the sitter's personality through subtle expressions. His style is somewhat similar to Raeburn but perhaps a bit more formal.

Now, the portrait in question shows a man with powdered white hair, wearing a dark blue coat with gold trim and a lace collar. The background is plain, and the man is holding a piece of paper. The style seems formal and composed, which aligns more with Reynolds or Ramsay. Let me think about the time period. William Hunter lived from 1718 to 1783, so the portrait would have been painted in the late 18th century. Both Reynolds and Ramsay were active during that time.

Reynolds was more associated with London, while Ramsay was based in Scotland. The portrait's style seems more formal and perhaps less romantic than Romney's. Raeburn's portraits are more naturalistic and have a bit more movement, which might not fit this still pose. So between Reynolds and Ramsay.

Looking at the options, the question is about the founder of the Hunterian. William Hunter was a physician and anatomist, and the Hunterian Museum was founded by his son, William Hunter II. The founder, William Hunter, was a physician and anatomist, so his portrait would likely be painted by someone associated with the medical or anatomical community. Reynolds was a member of the Royal Society of Arts and known for his portraits of the elite, but Ramsay was also a member of the Royal Society of Edinburgh and painted many portraits of Scottish figures, including medical professionals.

Given that the portrait is of William Hunter, the founder, and considering that Ramsay was more associated with Scottish figures, including medical professionals, it's possible that Ramsay painted this portrait. However, Reynolds was also a prominent portrait painter of the time. Let me check if there's any specific information about this particular portrait.

Wait, the options include both Reynolds and Ramsay. The question is which one painted it. If I recall correctly, the portrait of William Hunter is attributed to Allan Ramsay. But wait, that might be a different portrait. Let me think again. The Hunterian Museum's founder was William Hunter, and the museum's collection includes portraits of him. I think the portrait of William Hunter is indeed by Ramsay. But I need to confirm.

Alternatively, maybe it's Reynolds. Let me check some historical references. I remember that Ramsay painted a portrait of William Hunter, the anatomist, which is now in the Hunterian Museum. So the answer would be D. Allan Ramsay. But wait, the options are A. Reynolds, B. Raeburn, C. Romney, D. Ramsay. So D is the correct answer. But I need to make sure.

Alternatively, maybe the question is a trick. The founder is William Hunter, and the museum is named after him. The portrait is likely by Ramsay because he was a Scottish painter and known for his portraits of Scottish figures, including medical professionals. Reynolds was more associated with London and the British elite. So yes, D. Ramsay.

The portrait of William Hunter, the founder of the Hunterian, is attributed to **Allan Ramsay** (Option D). Ramsay was a prominent Scottish portrait painter active in the late 18th century, known for his naturalistic style and depictions of Scottish figures, including medical professionals. His formal and composed portraits align with the portrait's features, such as the powdered white hair, formal attire, and plain background. While Sir Joshua Reynolds was a renowned portraitist of the time, his style is more associated with the British elite, and the portrait's Scottish context points to Ramsay. 

**Answer:** D. Allan Ramsay
