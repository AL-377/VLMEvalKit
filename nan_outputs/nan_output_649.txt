Okay, let's see. The question is asking about a term that describes reading aloud in unison or parts with a whole class, small group, or individual students so that students hear the text at the same time they read it. The options are A. Choral Reading, B. Literature Circle, C. Readers Theatre, D. Shared Reading.

First, I need to recall what each of these terms means. Let me start with the definitions. 

Choral Reading: I think this is when a group of people read the same text aloud together. It could be the whole class, a small group, or even individuals reading parts. The key here is that everyone is reading at the same time, which is what the question mentions. So that seems like a strong candidate.

Literature Circle: That's a reading group where students discuss a book together. They might take different roles like summarizer, vocabulary leader, etc. But the term itself doesn't involve reading aloud; it's more about discussion. So probably not B.

Readers Theatre: This is a performance where actors read a script aloud, often with dialogue. It's more of a theatrical presentation rather than a reading activity in a classroom setting. So C might not fit here.

Shared Reading: I remember this is when the teacher reads aloud to the class, and the students follow along, sometimes joining in. But the question specifies that students read aloud themselves, not just follow along. So D might not be correct.

Wait, the question says "reading aloud in unison or parts with a whole class, small group, or individual students so that students hear the text at the same time they read it." So the students are reading aloud, not just listening. Choral Reading fits because it's a group reading aloud together. Shared Reading is more like the teacher reading and students following, but here it's the students reading aloud. So the answer should be A. Choral Reading.

The term that describes reading aloud together as a group, either unison or in parts, is **Choral Reading**. This involves students reading simultaneously, which aligns with the description provided. 

**Answer:** A. Choral Reading
