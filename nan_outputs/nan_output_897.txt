Okay, so I need to figure out which graph represents transdermal absorption by active transport. Let me start by recalling what transdermal absorption means. Transdermal absorption is when a drug is absorbed through the skin, right? And active transport is when the drug is transported across the skin cells against a concentration gradient, which requires energy. So, the rate of absorption would depend on the concentration gradient and the energy available.

Now, pharmacokinetic phenomena often relate to how the body processes a drug, including absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion. The graph in question here is plotting AUC (area under the curve) divided by dose versus dose. AUC is a measure of the total amount of the drug absorbed over time, so AUC/dose would give the concentration-time curve's area divided by the dose. If the graph is linear, that would mean the concentration is proportional to the dose, which is typical for first-order kinetics. But if it's not linear, maybe it's zero-order kinetics.

But the question is about transdermal absorption by active transport. Let me think. Active transport is saturable, meaning that as the concentration increases, the rate of absorption increases up to a point, then plateaus when all the carriers are saturated. So, the AUC/dose ratio would start to plateau as the dose increases. That would look like a curve that rises and then levels off. That sounds like Graph 1, which shows an initial increase followed by a plateau. Graph 2 is a straight line, which would be zero-order kinetics, and Graph 3 is a curve that increases without plateauing, which might be first-order kinetics. But active transport is saturable, so the curve should plateau. Therefore, Graph 1 should represent active transport. So the answer is A. Graph 1.

The graph representing transdermal absorption by active transport is **Graph 1**. Active transport is saturable, leading to a plateau in the AUC/dose ratio as the dose increases, which matches the curve shown in Graph 1. Graph 2 (linear) represents zero-order kinetics, and Graph 3 (increasing without plateau) corresponds to first-order kinetics. 

**Answer:** A. Graph 1
