Okay, so I need to figure out the correct classification for pest and disease control measures that use botanical extracts like neem oil. The options are Cultural, Biological, Chemical, Organic, or Don't know. Let me think through this step by step.

First, let's recall what each of these classifications means. Cultural practices usually involve things like crop rotation, mulching, or adjusting soil pH. Biological controls involve using natural predators or parasites to control pests. Chemicals are synthetic pesticides. Organic refers to methods that are natural and don't use synthetic chemicals. So, the question is about the classification of using botanical extracts.

Neem oil is derived from the neem tree, which is a natural source. So that would suggest it's organic. But wait, the options include "Organic" as an option. However, sometimes "organic" can be a bit confusing because it's a certification, not just a classification. But in this context, the question is about the classification, not the certification. So, if botanical extracts are considered organic in terms of their source, then the answer would be D. Organic.

But let me double-check. The other options: Cultural is about practices, not the product itself. Biological would be using living organisms, like ladybugs for aphids. Chemical is definitely synthetic. So neem oil is a natural product, so it's organic. Therefore, the correct answer should be D. Organic.

The classification for pest and disease control using botanical extracts like neem oil is **D. Organic**. Neem oil is derived from the neem tree, a natural source, and aligns with organic gardening principles, which emphasize the use of non-synthetic, natural products. Cultural, biological, and chemical classifications do not fit, as they pertain to practices, living organisms, or synthetic substances, respectively. 

**Answer:** D. Organic
