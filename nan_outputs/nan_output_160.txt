Okay, let's see. The question is about identifying a feature of the building shown in the two images. The options are A. a vaulted ceiling, B. pedimental recesses, C. radiating chapels, D. an atrium. 

First, I need to analyze the floor plan and the elevation drawing. The floor plan has a central rectangular area with a smaller square structure in the middle, which might be a courtyard or atrium. The elevation drawing shows a large, open space with a high ceiling, supported by columns. The roof structure is triangular, which is typical of a pediment, but the recesses mentioned in option B are part of the pediment. 

Looking at the floor plan, the central area is surrounded by colonnades, which are columns supporting a roof. The central area itself might be an atrium, which is a sunlit courtyard in Roman architecture. The elevation drawing shows a large open space with a high ceiling, which could be a vaulted ceiling. However, vaulted ceilings are usually arched, and the elevation here shows a triangular roof, which is more like a pediment. 

Wait, the pedimental recesses are part of the pediment itself. The pediment is the triangular section above the columns, and recesses might be decorative elements within that triangular area. But the question is about the building's feature, not the pediment's decoration. 

Radiating chapels would be like in a basilica, where chapels extend from the main nave, but I don't see that in the floor plan. The floor plan has a central area with a square in the middle, which might be an atrium. The elevation shows a large open space, which could be the atrium itself. 

So, the floor plan has an atrium, which is an open courtyard with a roof, allowing natural light. The elevation shows the atrium's high ceiling, which is likely vaulted. But vaulted ceilings are not the same as the pedimental recesses. The pedimental recesses would be part of the triangular pediment above the columns, but the question is about the building's feature, not the pediment's decoration. 

Therefore, the correct answer is probably D. an atrium, as the floor plan shows a central open area with a roof, which is characteristic of an atrium. The elevation drawing shows the high ceiling, which could be vaulted. However, the options are separate. 

Wait, the options are A to D. Let me check again. The floor plan has a central rectangular area with a square in the middle. The square might be the atrium. The elevation shows a large open space with columns and a high roof. The roof is triangular, which is a pediment, but the recesses are part of the pediment. The question is about the building's feature. 

So, the building has an atrium (D), which is the central open space. The vaulted ceiling (A) is part of the atrium's roof. The pedimental recesses (B) are part of the pediment. Radiating chapels (C) are not present here. 

Therefore, the correct answer is D. an atrium.

The building's floor plan features a central open area with a square structure, characteristic of an **atrium** (D), which is a sunlit courtyard in Roman architecture. The elevation drawing shows a high, vaulted ceiling (A), which aligns with the atrium's design. While the pedimental recesses (B) are part of the triangular pediment above the columns, the question asks for the building's feature, not decorative elements. Radiating chapels (C) are not present. 

**Answer:** D. an atrium
