Okay, so I need to figure out what's growing on these leaves. Let me start by looking at the image. The leaves have a lot of yellowish-green patches, and some of them look like they're covered in a powdery substance. The background has some purple flowers, which might be rhododendrons, since the plant in the picture looks like a rhododendron. 

First, I remember that rhododendrons are prone to certain fungal diseases. Let me think about the options. Algae (A) usually grows in water, so maybe not. Downy mildew (B) is a fungus that affects plants, but I think it's more common in cooler, wet conditions. Powdery mildew (C) is a common fungal disease that forms a white or grayish powder on leaves. Sooty mold (D) is a fungus that grows on honeydew from insects, like aphids, and it's black. 

Looking at the leaves here, the patches are yellow-green and powdery. Powdery mildew typically causes a white or grayish coating, but maybe it can be greenish in some cases. Sooty mold would be black, so that's probably not it. Downy mildew usually has a fuzzy appearance, which I don't see here. Algae would be green, but algae don't form a powdery layer. 

The leaves in the image have a powdery texture, and the color is a mix of green and yellow. Powdery mildew often causes leaves to curl or yellow, which matches what I see here. The yellowing could be because the fungus is blocking the plant's ability to photosynthesize. So, the answer is likely C, powdery mildew.

The leaves in the image exhibit yellow-green patches and a powdery coating, characteristic of **powdery mildew** (C). This fungal disease forms a white or grayish layer on plant surfaces, often causing leaf distortion and yellowing. Other options like algae (A) or sooty mold (D) are less likely due to their distinct appearances, while downy mildew (B) typically appears fuzzy. The yellow-green discoloration aligns with powdery mildew's symptoms. 

**Answer:** C. Powdery mildew
