Okay, let's see. The question is asking for the degrees of freedom (df) for the numerator in an ANOVA test. The options are A through D, with numbers 1, 2, 3, or 4. Hmm, I need to recall how degrees of freedom are calculated in ANOVA.

First, ANOVA is used to compare the means of three or more groups to see if there's a significant difference. The numerator df is related to the between-group variability, right? So, the formula for df between is the number of groups minus 1. Let me check that.

The problem mentions three different areas, so there are three groups. Therefore, the df between groups would be 3 - 1 = 2. Wait, but let me make sure. The options given are A.1, B.2, C.3, D.4. So if the answer is B.2, that would be correct. But let me think again to be sure.

Alternatively, maybe I'm confusing numerator df with denominator df. The numerator df is indeed the between-group df, which is k - 1, where k is the number of groups. Here, k is 3, so 3 - 1 = 2. The denominator df is the within-group df, which is N - k, where N is the total number of observations. Let me check that as well.

Looking at the table, each group has 5 entries. So Group 1 has 5, Group 2 has 5, Group 3 has 5. Total N is 5 + 5 + 5 = 15. Then denominator df would be 15 - 3 = 12. But the question is about the numerator df, which is 2. So the answer should be B.2. That seems right. Let me confirm once more.

Yes, in ANOVA, the between-group df is always k - 1, and the within-group df is N - k. So here, k=3, so between df=2. Therefore, the correct answer is B.2.

The degrees of freedom (df) for the numerator in an ANOVA test is calculated as the number of groups minus 1. Here, there are 3 groups (Area 1, 2, and 3), so the df between groups is \(3 - 1 = 2\). 

**Answer:** B. 2
