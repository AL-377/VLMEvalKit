Okay, so I need to figure out which point on this pressure vs. temperature graph corresponds to the critical point. Let me start by recalling what I know about phase diagrams. The critical point is where the liquid and gas phases become indistinguishable, right? At that point, there's no distinction between liquid and gas, and the substance is in a supercritical state. 

Looking at the graph, there are two curves: one that's curved downward and another that's curved upward. The downward curve is probably the liquid-vapor phase boundary, and the upward one might be the triple point or something else. Wait, but the critical point is a single point where the phase boundary ends. So, the critical point should be where the phase boundary ends. 

In the graph, the two curves intersect at point 7. That intersection point is likely the critical point because that's where the phase boundary ends. Before that, the liquid and vapor coexist, but beyond the critical point, there's no phase separation. So, point 7 is the critical point. Let me check the options. The options are A.1, B.2, C.5, D.7, E.9. So, D.7 is the correct answer. 

But wait, let me make sure I'm not confusing the critical point with the triple point. The triple point is where solid, liquid, and vapor coexist, but the critical point is where the liquid and vapor phases merge. So, yes, the critical point is where the phase boundary ends, which is point 7. The other points might be other phase transitions or critical points. For example, point 1 might be the triple point, but I'm not sure. The triple point is usually a lower temperature and higher pressure, but I need to visualize the graph. 

Alternatively, maybe the upward curve is the triple point. Let me think. The triple point is where solid, liquid, and vapor meet. But in a typical phase diagram, the triple point is a single point. However, in this graph, there's a curve that might represent the triple point. But since the critical point is where the phase boundary ends, which is point 7, that's the answer. 

So, the answer should be D.7.

The critical point occurs where the phase boundary between liquid and vapor ends, as there is no distinction between these phases beyond this point. In the graph, this intersection of the two curves is at point 7. 

**Answer:** D. 7
