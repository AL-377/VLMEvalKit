Okay, let's see. The question is asking which instrument is best suited to play the oboe part so that it sounds at the same pitch. The options are trombone, double bass, bassoon, and violin. Hmm.

First, I need to recall the pitch ranges of each instrument. Oboe is a woodwind instrument, typically pitched in the treble clef, right? Its range is usually from about middle C (C4) up to high C (C6). Let me check the sheet music here. The oboe part starts with a G below middle C (G3) and goes up to a high G (G6). So the oboe is playing a high range.

Now, looking at the options. Trombone is a brass instrument. Its range is usually from Bb3 to Bb5, maybe a bit higher. Double bass is a string instrument, very low range, like E1 to E4. Bassoon is another woodwind, similar to oboe but a bit lower in pitch. Its range is from C3 to C6. Violin is a string instrument, high range, like G3 to G5.

So comparing the oboe's range (G3 to G6) with the options. Trombone (Bb3 to Bb5) is lower than oboe. Double bass is even lower. Bassoon is similar but maybe a bit lower. Violin is higher than oboe. So the closest in pitch range would be the bassoon. But wait, the oboe is in the upper register. The bassoon's range is C3 to C6, which includes the high notes. But trombone is lower. So maybe the answer is the bassoon? But I need to think again.

Wait, the question says "sounds at the same pitch." So if the oboe is playing high notes, the other instrument needs to match that. Trombone can't reach high G. Double bass is too low. Violin is higher. So the closest would be the bassoon. But maybe there's something else. Wait, the oboe is in the treble clef, so the notes are written as written. The bassoon is also in the treble clef. So if the oboe is playing high notes, the bassoon can play them as well. Trombone is in the bass clef, so if it's transposing, maybe. But the question is about playing the same pitch. So if the oboe is playing a high G, the bassoon can play a high G as well. Trombone would have to transpose, but the question doesn't mention transposition. So the answer is likely the bassoon. But wait, the options are given as A to D, with the options labeled as box1 to box4. The original question's options are labeled as A, B, C, D. So the answer is C. box3 (bassoon). But I need to confirm.

Alternatively, maybe the trombone can play the same pitch if it's transposing. But the question is about playing the same pitch. If the oboe is playing a high G, the trombone would have to play a high G as well. But trombone's range is lower. So maybe the answer is the bassoon. Hmm. Let me check again. The oboe's range is G3 to G6. Trombone is Bb3 to Bb5. Double bass is E1 to E4. Violin is G3 to G5. So the closest is the bassoon. Therefore, the answer is C. box3.

The oboe's range spans from G3 to G6. Among the options, the **bassoon** (boxed C) has a range of C3 to C6, which overlaps with the oboe's high notes. Trombone (Bb3–Bb5) and violin (G3–G5) are too low or high, respectively. The double bass (E1–E4) is much lower. Thus, the **bassoon** is best suited to match the oboe's pitch.

**Answer:**  
C. box3
