Okay, so I need to figure out which artist from the Bloomsbury group Mark Gertler was in a relationship with. The options are Vanessa Bell, Eileen Agar, Dora Carrington, or Leonora Carrington. Let me start by recalling what I know about the Bloomsbury group. They were a group of artists, writers, and intellectuals in early 20th-century London, known for their bohemian lifestyle and support of each other's work. 

Mark Gertler was a painter associated with the Bloomsbury group. I remember that some of the key members were Vanessa Bell, Duncan Grant, Virginia Woolf, and Lytton Strachey. Vanessa Bell was married to Duncan Grant, but I think she had a relationship with Gertler. Wait, Vanessa Bell was married to Grant, but she also had a romantic relationship with Gertler. So that might be the answer. 

Let me check the other options. Eileen Agar was another artist, but I don't recall her being part of the Bloomsbury group. Dora Carrington was a Bloomsbury member, but she was more associated with the Surrealists, right? Leonora Carrington was another Surrealist, so probably not. 

So, the answer should be Vanessa Bell. But wait, I need to confirm. I think Vanessa Bell was indeed in a relationship with Gertler. She was married to Duncan Grant, but her relationship with Gertler was more famous. The painting in question might be one of Gertler's works, but I'm not sure. However, the key point is that among the Bloomsbury group, Vanessa Bell was the one he was in a relationship with. The other options don't fit as well. Eileen Agar was a student of Gertler, but not part of the Bloomsbury group. Dora Carrington was a friend but not romantically involved. So yes, the answer is A. Vanessa Bell.

The artist Mark Gertler was in a relationship with Vanessa Bell, a prominent member of the Bloomsbury group. Vanessa Bell was married to Duncan Grant but had a romantic connection with Gertler. The other options—Eileen Agar, Dora Carrington, and Leonora Carrington—do not align with Gertler's known relationships within the Bloomsbury circle. 

**Answer:** A. Vanessa Bell
