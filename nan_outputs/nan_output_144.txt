Okay, let's see. The question is about the arrangement of figural groups in the work shown in the image. The options are friezes, pediments, registers, or polyptychs. Hmm.

First, I need to recall what each of these terms means in the context of art, especially ancient Roman or Greek art. 

A frieze is a horizontal band of sculpture, often found on buildings like temples. They usually depict a continuous narrative or a series of figures in a row. The image here shows multiple figures arranged in horizontal rows, which sounds like a frieze. The top part of the image has a horizontal band with figures, and below that are two more horizontal bands with more figures. That seems to fit a frieze structure.

Pediments are triangular sections at the top of a building, like a temple, and they typically have a single central figure or a group of figures. The image doesn't show a triangular section; it's more rectangular and horizontal. So pediment probably isn't the right answer here.

Registers, on the other hand, are horizontal divisions in a relief. In Roman sarcophagi, for example, there are often multiple registers with different scenes or figures. The image here has three horizontal bands, each with different scenes. The top one has a group of men, the middle has a more complex scene with a central figure on a donkey, and the bottom has figures in different poses. Each of these horizontal sections is a register. So that makes sense.

Polyptychs are multi-panel paintings or sculptures, usually with multiple doors that open. They're more like folding panels, not horizontal bands. The image here is a single horizontal structure, so polyptych is probably not it.

So putting it all together: the horizontal bands with multiple figures in each section are called registers. The top one is a register, the middle one is another register, and the bottom one is a third register. Each register tells a different part of the story. Therefore, the correct answer should be C. registers.

The figural groups in the image are arranged in horizontal bands, each depicting a distinct narrative or scene. These horizontal divisions are characteristic of **registers**, which are common in Roman sarcophagi and other sculptural works. The top, middle, and bottom sections each contain separate figures and scenes, fitting the definition of registers. 

**Answer:** C. registers
