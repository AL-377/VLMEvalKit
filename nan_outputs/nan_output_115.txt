Okay, so I need to figure out what this painting is called from the options given. Let me start by looking at the image. The painting shows a woman in a white dress holding a parasol, walking through a field of flowers. There's also a child in the background, maybe a boy, looking up at her. The style looks impressionistic, with lots of brushstrokes and a bright, airy feel. The sky is blue with white clouds, and the colors are vibrant and light.

Now, let me go through the options. Option A is "Lady with an Ermine," which is a famous painting by Leonardo da Vinci. That's a portrait of a woman in a dark dress, not the bright, outdoor scene I see here. So probably not A.

Option B is "First Steps," which I think is a sculpture by Auguste Rodin. That's a statue of a child learning to walk, but this painting is of a woman outdoors, so B doesn't seem right.

Option C is "Nude Descending a Staircase, No. 2," by Marcel Duchamp. That's an abstract painting with a woman in a flowing dress, but again, this is a different style and subject. The woman here is clothed and in a natural setting, so C might not be it.

Option D is "Woman with a parasol," which sounds familiar. The painting I see matches that description perfectly. The woman in white with a parasol, the outdoor setting, the impressionistic style. That's a well-known painting by Monet, I believe. Let me confirm. Yes, "Woman with a Parasol" is indeed a famous work by Claude Monet. The other options don't fit the image at all. So the correct answer must be D.

The painting depicted is "Woman with a Parasol" by Claude Monet. The bright outdoor scene, impressionistic style, and the woman in white with a parasol align with this renowned artwork. The other options (Lady with an Ermine, First Steps, and Nude Descending a Staircase) do not match the visual elements of the image. 

**Answer:** D. Woman with a parasol
