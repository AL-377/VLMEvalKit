Okay, so I need to figure out what's causing this leaf issue in potatoes. Let me start by looking at the image. The leaf has a powdery white coating, which is a common symptom of some fungal diseases. The options given are Downy mildew, Early blight, Don't know, Powdery mildew, and Late blight. 

First, Downy mildew usually causes a fuzzy white or gray growth on the underside of leaves, right? And it's more common in cool, wet conditions. But the image shows a powdery white layer on the upper surface. So maybe that's not Downy mildew. 

Early blight is caused by Alternaria solani. Symptoms include brown spots with concentric rings, and sometimes a fuzzy growth on the edges. The image doesn't show any concentric rings or fuzzy edges, so that might not be it. 

The question is about potato cultivation, so the answer is likely one of the options related to potato diseases. Powdery mildew is a common one, especially in warm, dry conditions. It forms a white powdery coating on the leaves. That matches what I see here. 

Late blight is caused by Phytophthora infestans, which is a water mold. It causes dark, wet lesions on the leaves, often with a white fuzzy growth on the underside. The image doesn't show any dark lesions or white growth on the underside, so that's probably not it. 

So putting it all together: the symptoms—powdery white coating on the upper surface—point to Powdery mildew (option D). Downy mildew is on the underside, Early blight has concentric rings, Late blight is wet and has a different appearance. Therefore, the correct answer should be D.

The leaf in the image exhibits a powdery white coating on the upper surface, which is characteristic of **Powdery mildew** (option D). This fungal disease thrives in warm, dry conditions and forms a distinct white layer on potato leaves. Other options like Downy mildew (A) affect the underside, Early blight (B) has concentric ring lesions, and Late blight (E) causes dark, wet lesions. Thus, the root cause is identified as **Powdery mildew**. 

**Answer:** D. Powdery mildew
