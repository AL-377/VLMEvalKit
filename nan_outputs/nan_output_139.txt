Okay, let's see. The question is asking who created this painting. The options are Martin Schongauer, Titian, Rogier van der Weyden, and Hans Memling. Hmm. First, I need to recall which of these artists is known for religious paintings, especially the Nativity scene, which this image seems to depict. 

The painting shows the Holy Family with a shepherd boy. The style looks somewhat Renaissance, with attention to detail and perspective. Let me think about each option. 

Martin Schongauer was a German painter and engraver, known for his religious prints, but I don't recall him creating large paintings like this. Maybe not. 

Titian, also known as Tiziano Vecelli, was an Italian painter from the Renaissance period. He was famous for his religious works, portraits, and mythological paintings. The style here, with the soft colors and the way the figures are depicted, might be characteristic of Titian. The landscape in the background also seems to have a serene quality that's typical of his later works. 

Rogier van der Weyden was a Flemish painter, also active in the 15th century. He's known for his use of sfumato, a technique of soft blending of colors and shading, which creates a sense of depth. However, I'm not sure if this painting uses that technique. The colors here seem more vibrant and the figures are more defined. Maybe not Van der Weyden. 

Hans Memling was another German-Flemish painter, known for his portraits and religious paintings. His style is more subdued, with less color and more emphasis on the figures' expressions. This painting has more vivid colors and a more dynamic composition, so maybe not Memling. 

So, narrowing down, Titian seems the most likely. The style, the use of color, and the overall composition are reminiscent of his works. The shepherd boy with a staff is a common figure in Renaissance Nativity scenes, and Titian often included such elements. Let me check if there's any other detail that might confirm this. The landscape in the background, with the hills and the angel, is painted in a way that's characteristic of Titian's later works. 

I think the answer is B. Titian.

The painting depicts the Holy Family with a shepherd boy, a subject often associated with Renaissance religious art. The vivid colors, attention to detail, and serene landscape are hallmarks of Titian's style. His works frequently featured such compositions, and the composition aligns with his later, more refined techniques. While other artists like Van der Weyden or Memling might have influenced certain elements, Titian's mastery of color and composition best matches this image. 

**Answer:** B. TITIAN
