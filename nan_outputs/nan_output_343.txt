Okay, let's see. The question is asking how many DEPTs a COURSE can be OFFERed by in the ER diagram. The options are from A to E, with E being none of the other answers. 

First, I need to recall the ER diagram structure here. The diagram shows various entities connected by relationships. The key here is to find the relationship between DEPT and COURSE. 

Looking at the diagram, there's a relationship called "OFFERS" between DEPT and COURSE. The multiplicity for DEPT in this relationship is (0,N), meaning a department can offer zero or more courses. For COURSE, the multiplicity is (1,1), which means each course is offered by exactly one department. 

Wait, let me confirm. The OFFERS relationship is between DEPT and COURSE. The arrow is pointing from DEPT to COURSE, indicating that DEPT is the parent entity. The multiplicity on DEPT is (0,N), meaning a department can have zero or more courses. On the other hand, the multiplicity on COURSE is (1,1), meaning each course is associated with exactly one department. 

So, if a course is offered by a department, that department must have at least one course. But a department can have multiple courses. Therefore, the number of DEPTs a COURSE can be offered by is 1, because each course is in exactly one department. 

But wait, the options include D. N, which would mean a department can offer multiple courses. But the question is about how many DEPTs a COURSE can be OFFERed by. So if a course is in one department, that's one DEPT. If it's in multiple departments, but the question is asking how many DEPTs a single COURSE can be offered by, then it's 1. 

But maybe I'm misunderstanding. Let me check again. The OFFERS relationship is between DEPT and COURSE. So each course is in one department, but a department can have multiple courses. So the number of DEPTs a course can be offered by is 1. Therefore, the answer should be B. 1. 

But wait, the options are A. 0, B.1, C.2, D.N, E. None. So if the answer is 1, then B. But maybe there's a trick here. Let me think again. 

Wait, the OFFERS relationship is (0,N) for DEPT and (1,1) for COURSE. So DEPT can have 0 or more courses, but each COURSE is in exactly one DEPT. So the number of DEPTs a course can be offered by is 1. Therefore, the answer is B.1. 

But let me check if there's another relationship. For example, maybe there's a way a course can be offered by multiple departments through some other relationship. But looking at the diagram, the only relationship between DEPT and COURSE is OFFERS. So no, there's no other way. Therefore, the answer is B.1.

The OFFERS relationship between DEPT and COURSE has a multiplicity of (0,N) for DEPT and (1,1) for COURSE. This means each course is offered by exactly one department (1,1), while a department can offer multiple courses (0,N). Therefore, a single course can only be offered by **1** department. 

**Answer:** B. 1
