Okay, let's see. The question is asking which term refers to the end of the story, or the very last event that takes place. The options are Resolution, Exposition, Conflict, Rising Action. 

First, I need to recall what each of these terms means in the context of storytelling. 

Exposition is the part where the background information is given, like introducing the characters and setting up the problem. So that's probably not the end. 

Conflict is the main problem or struggle in the story. That's more about the middle or the climax, not the end. 

Rising Action is the part where the conflict is building up. So that's leading up to the climax, not the conclusion. 

Resolution, on the other hand, is the part where the conflict is resolved. That would be the end of the story, right? After the climax, the story wraps up with the resolution. 

The image shows the phrase "and they lived happily ever after," which is a classic resolution. So the answer should be Resolution. 

Wait, but let me double-check. The options are A to D. The question is about the very last event. Resolution is the conclusion, so that's the end. Exposition is the beginning. Conflict is the problem. Rising Action is the buildup. Yeah, Resolution makes sense here. I think that's correct.

The term that refers to the end of the story, or the very last event, is **Resolution**. 

**Answer:** A. Resolution
