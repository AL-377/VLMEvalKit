Okay, let's try to figure out this question. The graph shows the percentage of villages depopulated in different regions of the Western Roman Empire between 400 and 500 C.E. The options are about possible causes for this depopulation. Let me go through each option one by one.

First, the graph has regions like Italy, South Gaul, South Spain, North Spain, Britain, Belgica, and North Gaul. The y-axis is percent depopulated, and the x-axis is the years 400 and 500 C.E. Each region's line shows how much depopulation occurred over these decades.

Looking at the data, by 500 C.E., North Gaul has almost 100% depopulated, which is the highest. Then Belgica is around 80%, and the others are lower. By 400 C.E., some regions like Italy and South Gaul have around 20% depopulated, while others like North Spain and Britain have higher percentages. So over the 100 years, depopulation increased significantly in most regions.

Now, the options:

A. The spread of the bubonic plague by the Mongol invasions. Hmm, the Mongol invasions happened in the 13th century, right? So by 400-500 C.E., the Mongols hadn't invaded Europe yet. The Black Death, which was bubonic plague, started in the 14th century. So this option seems too late. Plus, the Mongols were in Asia, so their invasions wouldn't directly affect the Western Roman Empire. So probably not A.

B. Migrations to Christian population centers in the Mediterranean. If people were migrating to Christian areas, that might reduce depopulation in those regions. But the graph shows depopulation increasing in most areas. If people were moving to Christian centers, those regions would have lower depopulation. But the graph shows higher percentages in some regions. So maybe B isn't the right answer.

C. Forced migration of populations by the Roman government. The Roman government might have moved people to other areas, but depopulation is about villages becoming empty, not moving people. If the government forced migration, maybe the depopulated areas would have people moving to others, but the graph shows depopulation increasing. So maybe C isn't the cause here.

D. Invasions by Germanic and Central Asian peoples. This makes sense. The Migration Period is a well-known period where Germanic tribes like the Visigoths, Vandals, and others migrated into the Roman Empire. These invasions would lead to depopulation as the invaders destroyed settlements, killed people, or forced them to leave. Also, the spread of these tribes would lead to depopulation in their paths. The graph shows significant depopulation in regions like North Gaul and Belgica by 500 C.E., which aligns with the Migration Period. So this seems plausible.

Wait, but let me check the timeline again. The Migration Period started around 400 C.E. and continued into the 5th century. So by 500 C.E., many areas were depopulated due to invasions. The graph shows that by 500 C.E., North Gaul is almost completely depopulated, which would be consistent with Germanic invasions there. So D seems correct.

But let me think again. The Mongol invasions (A) are too late. The Christian migrations (B) don't explain the depopulation. Forced migration by the Roman government (C) is unlikely, as the government would probably try to maintain population rather than depopulate. So D is the most plausible answer.

The graph illustrates significant depopulation in various regions of the Western Roman Empire between 400 and 500 C.E., with North Gaul and Belgica experiencing the highest rates by 500 C.E. The Migration Period, marked by Germanic and Central Asian invasions, explains this trend. These invasions led to widespread destruction of settlements, displacement of populations, and increased mortality, resulting in depopulation. Options A (Mongol invasions) and B (Christian migrations) are chronologically inconsistent, while C (forced government migration) is implausible. Thus, **D** is the correct answer. 

**Answer:** D. Invasions by Germanic and Central Asian peoples
