Okay, let's see. The question is asking about the type of sleeve in the image. The options are Bell, Puff, Cap, or Raglan. 

First, I need to recall what each type of sleeve looks like. Bell sleeves are usually wide and flared, like a bell shape. Puff sleeves are similar but have more volume, often gathered at the shoulder. Cap sleeves are short, covering just the shoulder area. Raglan sleeves are set-in sleeves that go from the shoulder to the armhole, which might be a bit different.

Looking at the image, the person is wearing a black top with long sleeves. The sleeves appear to be wide and flared, especially noticeable at the ends. They seem to flare out significantly, which makes me think of bell sleeves. However, sometimes puff sleeves can also be wide, but the way they're gathered might differ. 

The top is a bit puffy around the shoulders, but the main feature is the wide, bell-like shape at the end of the sleeve. The way the sleeve is cut seems to have a lot of volume, which is characteristic of bell sleeves. Puff sleeves usually have gathers around the shoulder, but the image doesn't show that. Cap sleeves are much shorter, so that's not it. Raglan sleeves are more fitted, so that's probably not either.

So, considering the wide, flared end of the sleeve, the answer is likely A. Bell Sleeve.

The sleeve in the image is wide and flared, characteristic of a bell shape. Bell sleeves are known for their bell-like silhouette, which matches the description here. Puff sleeves, while also voluminous, typically have gathers around the shoulder, which isn't evident here. Cap sleeves are short and cover only the shoulder, and raglan sleeves are set-in with a fitted look. 

**Answer:** A. Bell Sleeve
