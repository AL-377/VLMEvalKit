Okay, so I need to figure out which point on the phase diagram shows the substance being solely in the solid phase at equilibrium. Let me start by recalling what phase diagrams represent. 

Phase diagrams typically show the states of matter (solid, liquid, gas) as a function of temperature and pressure. The lines on the diagram represent transitions between these phases. The key lines are the triple point, where all three phases coexist, and the melting point curve (solid to liquid) and the vaporization curve (liquid to gas). 

Looking at the diagram, there's a curve that goes from the lower left (point A) to the upper right (point C), which I think is the melting point curve. Then there's another curve from point C to point D, which might be the vaporization curve. The triple point is where all three phases meet, probably near point B. 

Now, the question is asking for the point where the substance is solely in the solid phase. That should be below the melting point curve, right? Because below the melting point curve, the substance is solid. So points A and B would be in the solid phase, but point B is the triple point where solid, liquid, and gas coexist. So point A is entirely solid. 

Wait, but the options are A, B, C, D, E. Let me check the positions. Point A is on the lower left, which is likely the solid phase. Point B is somewhere in the middle left, but above point A. Point C is on the upper middle, and point D is on the upper right. Point E is on the far right, lower part. 

So if the melting point curve is from A to C, then below that curve (to the left of C) is solid, and above it is liquid. The vaporization curve is from C to D, so above that is gas. The triple point is where all three meet, which is probably near B. 

Therefore, the point where the substance is solely in the solid phase would be point A, since it's below the melting point curve. Points B and C are near the triple point and the vaporization curve, so they have multiple phases. Point D is on the vaporization curve, so it's a mixture of liquid and gas. Point E is on the far right, which is probably the gas phase. 

So the answer should be A. (A)

The phase diagram shows transitions between solid, liquid, and gas phases. The melting point curve (solid to liquid) runs from point A to C, and the vaporization curve (liquid to gas) from C to D. The triple point (where all three phases coexist) is near point B. 

- **Point A** lies below the melting point curve, indicating the substance is solely in the solid phase. 
- **Point B** is the triple point, where solid, liquid, and gas coexist. 
- **Point C** is on the vaporization curve, so it contains liquid and gas. 
- **Point D** is on the vaporization curve, also containing liquid and gas. 
- **Point E** is on the gas phase side of the vaporization curve. 

Thus, the substance is solely in the solid phase at equilibrium at **(A)**. 

**Answer:** A. (A)
