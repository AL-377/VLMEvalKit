Okay, so I need to figure out which of these metals is the most reactive based on the given standard electrode potentials. Let me start by recalling what I know about electrochemistry. The standard electrode potential (E°) tells us the tendency of a metal to lose electrons and act as a reducing agent. A more negative E° value means the metal is more likely to lose electrons, making it a stronger reducing agent. Conversely, a more positive E° value means the metal is a weaker reducing agent, so it's more likely to be oxidized.

Looking at the options given: A is Au, B is Cu, C is Ni, D is Fe, and E is Na. The question is asking which is the most reactive. So, I need to compare the E° values of each metal's reduction reaction. The metal with the most negative E° should be the most reactive because it has the highest tendency to lose electrons.

Let me list out the E° values again for clarity:

- Au: +1.420 V
- Cu: +0.340 V
- Ni: -0.250 V
- Fe: -0.440 V
- Na: -2.924 V

Now, comparing these values. The more negative the E°, the more reactive the metal. So, Na has the most negative E° at -2.924 V. That means Na is the strongest reducing agent, so it should be the most reactive metal here. Let me check the other options to confirm. Au is +1.420, which is positive, so it's a weaker reducing agent. Cu is +0.340, also positive. Ni is -0.250, which is less negative than Na. Fe is -0.440, which is even less negative than Ni. So yes, Na has the most negative E°, making it the most reactive.

Wait, but let me make sure I'm not mixing up anything. Sometimes, people get confused between reduction and oxidation potentials. But the standard electrode potential is for the reduction reaction. So, a more negative E° means the metal is more likely to lose electrons (reduce), which is the definition of a reducing agent. Therefore, the metal with the most negative E° is the most reactive. So, Na is the answer. The options are A to E, so E is Na. That seems right.

To determine the most reactive metal, we compare the standard electrode potentials (E°) of their reduction reactions. A more negative E° indicates a stronger tendency to lose electrons (acting as a reducing agent). 

- **Au**: +1.420 V (least reactive)  
- **Cu**: +0.340 V  
- **Ni**: -0.250 V  
- **Fe**: -0.440 V  
- **Na**: -2.924 V (most reactive)  

The most negative E° is for **Na** (-2.924 V), meaning it is the strongest reducing agent and thus the most reactive metal.  

**Answer:** E. Na
