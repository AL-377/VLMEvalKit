Okay, let's see. The question is asking for the degrees of freedom (df) for the numerator in an ANOVA test. The options are A. 2, B. 3, C. 4, D. 5. 

First, I need to recall what ANOVA is. ANOVA, or Analysis of Variance, is used to compare the means of three or more groups to determine if at least one of the means is significantly different from the others. The numerator degrees of freedom in ANOVA is related to the number of groups minus one. 

Looking at the table provided, there are four teams: Team 1, Team 2, Team 3, and Team 4. So that's four groups. The formula for the numerator df is usually (number of groups - 1). So 4 - 1 = 3. Therefore, the numerator df should be 3. 

Let me double-check. The options are A. 2, B. 3, C. 4, D. 5. So 3 is option B. That seems right. 

Wait, but maybe I'm mixing up numerator and denominator degrees of freedom? Let me confirm. In ANOVA, the numerator degrees of freedom is indeed the degrees of freedom for the between-group variance, which is calculated as the number of groups minus one. The denominator degrees of freedom is the within-group variance, which is the total number of observations minus the number of groups. 

In this case, each team has 5 entries (since there are 5 rows in the table). So total observations are 4 teams * 5 games = 20. Then denominator df would be 20 - 4 = 16. But the question is specifically about the numerator df, which is 3. So the answer should be B. 3. 

I think that's correct. Let me just make sure there's no trick here. The problem mentions "mean goals scored per game," so it's comparing the means of the four teams. The numerator df is always the number of groups minus one. So yes, 4 teams minus 1 is 3. Therefore, the correct answer is B.

The degrees of freedom (df) for the numerator in an ANOVA test is calculated as the number of groups minus one. Here, there are four teams (groups), so the numerator df is \(4 - 1 = 3\). 

**Answer:** B. 3
