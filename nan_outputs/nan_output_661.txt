Okay, let's see. The question is about a term that refers to when text and illustration tell different stories, like in the book "Rosie's Walk." The options are Contrast, Reasoning, Counterpoint, and Printmaking. Hmm.

First, I need to recall what each term means. Contrast is when two things are different, right? Like the difference between text and illustration. Reasoning is about thinking or figuring things out. Counterpoint is a musical term where two melodies are played against each other. Printmaking is an art technique. So, the key here is that the text and illustration are telling different stories. 

In "Rosie's Walk," the text is the farmer's perspective, and the illustration is the fox's perspective. So the fox is walking around the farm without being noticed, but the text says the farmer is walking around the farm. That's a classic example of text and illustration telling different stories. So the term that describes this situation would be Counterpoint. Because in music, counterpoint is when two melodies are in opposition, which is similar to the text and illustration here. 

Wait, but let me make sure. Contrast is about differences, but the term "counterpoint" specifically refers to the relationship between two melodies. So maybe that's the right answer. Printmaking is about creating art, which isn't related here. Reasoning is not a term used in this context. So yes, Counterpoint seems correct.

The term that refers to text and illustration telling different stories, such as in "Rosie's Walk," is **Counterpoint**. This musical term describes two melodies interacting, which mirrors the contrast between the farmer’s perspective (text) and the fox’s unseen presence (illustration). 

**Answer:** C. Counterpoint
