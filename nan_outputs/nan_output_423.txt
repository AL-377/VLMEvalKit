Okay, let's see. The question is about finding the equilibrium quantity of bagels if the country doesn't trade. The options are A. 2, B. 4, C. 6, D. 8. Hmm. So, equilibrium occurs where the supply and demand curves intersect. Right, because that's where the quantity demanded equals the quantity supplied, and the price is determined by the intersection point.

Looking at the graph, the supply curve is the red one, and the demand curve is the blue one. The intersection point is where they cross each other. Let me check the coordinates. The x-axis is quantity, and the y-axis is price. The intersection seems to be at the point where the price is $8. Let me confirm that. 

At the intersection, the price is $8. Let me check the supply curve. When the price is $8, the quantity supplied is 4. On the demand curve, when the price is $8, the quantity demanded is also 4. So, that's the equilibrium point. Therefore, the equilibrium quantity is 4, which is option B. 

Wait, but let me double-check. Sometimes graphs can be tricky. Let me see the exact intersection. The supply curve starts at (0,4) and goes up with a positive slope. The demand curve starts at (0,12) and goes down with a negative slope. They cross at (4,8). So yes, at 4 units, both supply and demand are 4. So the equilibrium quantity is 4. So the answer should be B. 4.

The equilibrium quantity occurs where the supply and demand curves intersect. From the graph, the intersection point is at a price of $8, where both the supply (4 units) and demand (4 units) curves meet. Thus, the equilibrium quantity is **4**.

**Answer:** B. 4
