Okay, so I need to figure out who created this painting. The options are A. Serge Vinogradov, B. Georges Seurat, C. Vincent Willem van Gogh, D. Paul Gauguin. Let me start by looking at the image provided. It's a pointillist painting of a nude male figure. The style is very characteristic of Seurat's work. Pointillism is a technique where small dots of color are applied in patterns to form an image, creating a textured effect. Seurat was known for this method, especially in his later works like "A Sunday on La Grande Jatte." The figure in the image has a smooth, almost geometric appearance, which aligns with Seurat's style. 

Van Gogh and Gauguin are associated with post-impressionism, which includes more expressive and symbolic elements, often using bold colors and thick brushstrokes. While Van Gogh did some pointillist pieces, they are not his primary style. Gauguin's works are more in the style of primitivism and often have a more decorative, flat quality. 

Serge Vinogradov is a Russian artist, but I don't recall him being a pointillist. His work might be in different styles. So, considering the options, the most likely answer is B. Georges Seurat. The pointillist technique and the figure's posture and pose are consistent with his later works. The painting's style doesn't match Van Gogh or Gauguin's known styles. Therefore, the correct answer should be B.

The painting in question is a pointillist work characterized by its use of small, distinct dots of color to form an image. This technique is most closely associated with **Georges Seurat**, a French artist renowned for his contributions to the pointillist movement. The smooth, geometric texture and the figure's composed posture align with Seurat's later works, such as "A Sunday on La Grande Jatte." Van Gogh and Gauguin are linked to post-impressionism, which typically employs more expressive brushstrokes and symbolic elements, while Vinogradov is a Russian artist whose style does not align with pointillism. 

**Answer:** B. GEORGES SEURAT
