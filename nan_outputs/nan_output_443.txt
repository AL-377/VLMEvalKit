Okay, so I need to figure out which strategy is dominant for both firms in this prisoners' dilemma game. Let me start by recalling what a dominant strategy is. A dominant strategy is one that provides a higher payoff for a player, regardless of what the other player does. So, if Firm 1 chooses High output, what's the best Firm 2 can do? Let's look at the payoffs for Firm 2 when Firm 1 is in High output.

If Firm 1 chooses High output, Firm 2 can choose either Low output or High output. The payoffs for Firm 2 would be 0 if they choose Low output and 2 if they choose High output. Since 2 is higher than 0, Firm 2's dominant strategy here is High output when Firm 1 is High. 

Now, if Firm 1 chooses Low output, Firm 2's options are 3 (Low output) or 5 (High output). Here, 5 is higher than 3, so Firm 2's dominant strategy is High output again. Wait, so regardless of what Firm 1 does, Firm 2's best response is High output. That would mean High output is a dominant strategy for Firm 2. 

Now, let's check Firm 1's perspective. If Firm 1 is in High output, Firm 2's best response is High output, so Firm 1's payoff is 2. If Firm 1 is in Low output, Firm 2's best response is High output, so Firm 1's payoff is 0. Comparing 2 and 0, Firm 1's dominant strategy is High output. 

So both firms have a dominant strategy of High output. Therefore, the answer should be option A. Let me double-check. If both choose High output, Firm 1 gets 2 and Firm 2 gets 2. If both choose Low, they both get 3. But since each firm can guarantee a higher payoff by choosing High regardless of the other's choice, it's a dominant strategy. Yeah, that makes sense. So option A is correct.

The dominant strategy for both firms is to choose "High output" (low price). 

**Step-by-Step Explanation:**
1. **Firm 2's Payoff Comparison:**
   - If Firm 1 chooses **High output**, Firm 2's payoffs are 0 (Low) vs. 2 (High). The dominant choice is **High**.
   - If Firm 1 chooses **Low output**, Firm 2's payoffs are 3 (Low) vs. 5 (High). The dominant choice is **High**.

2. **Firm 1's Payoff Comparison:**
   - If Firm 2 chooses **High output**, Firm 1's payoffs are 2 (High) vs. 0 (Low). The dominant choice is **High**.
   - If Firm 2 chooses **Low output**, Firm 1's payoffs are 3 (Low) vs. 5 (High). The dominant choice is **High**.

Since both firms have a dominant strategy of **High output** regardless of the other's choice, the correct answer is:

**A. Dominant strategy is 'High output' (low price) for both firms.**
