Okay, so I need to figure out if this graph is Hamiltonian. Let me start by recalling what a Hamiltonian graph is. A Hamiltonian graph is one that has a cycle that visits every vertex exactly once. So, the question is whether there's a path that goes through all six vertices without repeating any, right?

First, let me visualize the graph. There are six vertices arranged in a hexagon, but with some additional edges. Let me count the edges. Each vertex in the hexagon is connected to its two adjacent vertices. Then, there are two more edges: one connecting the top vertex to the bottom vertex, and another connecting the left vertex to the right vertex. So, the graph has six vertices and eight edges. Wait, no, hold on. Let me check again. The hexagon has six edges, and then two more edges, so total eight edges. Hmm, but maybe I should draw it mentally. Let's label the vertices A, B, C, D, E, F in a hexagon. Then, the two additional edges are A connected to D and B connected to E. So, the graph is a hexagon with two diagonals. 

Now, to check if it's Hamiltonian, I need to see if there's a cycle that includes all six vertices. Let's think about possible cycles. The hexagon itself is a cycle that includes all six vertices, but wait, the hexagon is a cycle of length six. However, in the given graph, the edges are not all present in the hexagon. The diagonals A-D and B-E are present. So, maybe there's a way to traverse the graph using these diagonals to form a Hamiltonian cycle.

Let me try to construct such a cycle. Let's start at vertex A. If I go to D (since A is connected to D), then from D, can I go to another vertex? Let's see. D is connected to A and E. If I go to E, then from E, I can go to B (since B is connected to E). Then from B, go to C (B is connected to C). From C, go to F (C is connected to F). From F, go to A (F is connected to A). Wait, but that would be A-D-E-B-C-F-A, which is a cycle that includes all six vertices. Let me check the edges:

A-D (exists), D-E (exists), E-B (exists), B-C (exists), C-F (exists), F-A (exists). So yes, that's a cycle that goes through all six vertices. So, this graph is Hamiltonian.

But wait, let me make sure there isn't a shorter cycle or a different cycle. Alternatively, maybe starting at a different vertex. Let's try starting at B. If I go to E (B-E exists), then E is connected to D. So E-D. Then D is connected to A. So D-A. Then A is connected to F. So A-F. Then F is connected to C. So F-C. Then C is connected to B. So C-B. That's another cycle: B-E-D-A-F-C-B. That's also a Hamiltonian cycle. So regardless of starting point, there's a cycle that covers all vertices.

Alternatively, maybe another path. Let's see. Starting at C. C is connected to F and B. Let's go to F. Then F is connected to A. Then A is connected to D. Then D is connected to E. Then E is connected to B. Then B is connected to C. So that's C-F-A-D-E-B-C. Again, a cycle through all vertices.

So, in all cases, there's a Hamiltonian cycle. Therefore, the answer should be A. Yes, it's Hamiltonian.

The graph in question is a hexagon with two additional diagonals connecting vertices A-D and B-E. To determine if it's Hamiltonian, we need a cycle visiting all six vertices. 

1. **Cycle Construction**: Starting at vertex A, follow the path A-D-E-B-C-F-A. This uses edges A-D, D-E, E-B, B-C, C-F, and F-A, forming a cycle that includes all six vertices.
2. **Verification**: Another valid cycle is B-E-D-A-F-C-B, confirming the graph's Hamiltonian property.

Thus, the graph is Hamiltonian.

**Answer:** A. Yes
