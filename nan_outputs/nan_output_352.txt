Okay, let's see. The question is about keeping rhythm exciting and active, and we need to choose the correct option from A to D. The options are Repetition, Unity, Variety, Balance.

First, I need to understand what each term means in the context of rhythm and design. Rhythm in design refers to the pattern of elements that creates a sense of movement or flow. So, if the rhythm is exciting and active, it's probably not about repetition or balance, which can make things static. Repetition usually creates a predictable pattern, which might not be exciting. Balance is about symmetry or proportion, which also tends to be more static. So maybe A and D are out.

Then there's Unity and Variety. Unity is when elements are consistent and harmonious, creating a sense of wholeness. Variety is when elements differ and create contrast. If the rhythm is exciting and active, having variety would make it more dynamic. Repetition would make it too monotonous. So Variety (C) seems like the answer.

But wait, let me think again. Sometimes in design, even with variety, you can have a sense of rhythm through different elements. But if the rhythm is "exciting and active," maybe it's about having a mix of different elements that move the eye around, creating a lively atmosphere. Repetition might make it too uniform, which could be boring. So Variety (C) is probably the right choice here.

To maintain an exciting and active rhythm, **variety** (C) is essential. Repetition (A) and balance (D) create static patterns, while unity (B) emphasizes consistency, both of which would dull the rhythm. Variety introduces contrast and movement, keeping the design lively and engaging. 

**Answer:** C. Variety
