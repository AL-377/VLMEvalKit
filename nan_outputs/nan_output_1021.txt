Okay, let's see. The question is asking which theory of education focuses on the labels acquired through the educational process. The options are Critical Sociology, Feminist Theory, Functionalist Theory, and Symbolic Interactionism.

First, I need to recall what each of these theories emphasizes. Let me start by breaking them down one by one.

Critical Sociology: I think this is more about analyzing social structures and power inequalities. It might look at how education reinforces social hierarchies. But does it specifically focus on labels? Maybe not directly. Maybe more about the critique of education systems.

Feminist Theory: This is about gender and how it affects education. It might examine how educational systems perpetuate gender roles or how women are treated differently. Again, maybe not the primary focus here.

Functionalist Theory: This is about how society functions as a whole. It might look at how education serves the needs of the society, like preparing people for their roles. But labels? Maybe not. Functionalist theories often focus on the social functions of education, like socialization and maintaining social order.

Symbolic Interactionism: This theory is about how people interact with symbols and labels. It's more about the micro-level, how individuals use symbols in their daily interactions. For example, how a label like "student" affects behavior. So if someone is labeled as a student, they might internalize that identity and act accordingly. That seems to fit the question about labels acquired through education.

So, the key here is that Symbolic Interactionism emphasizes the social construction of meaning through interaction. Labels (like "student") are part of that process. Critical Sociology and Feminist Theory might have elements related to labels, but Functionalist Theory is more about the broader functions of education. Therefore, the answer should be Symbolic Interactionism.

The theory that focuses on the labels acquired through the educational process is **Symbolic Interactionism**. This approach emphasizes how individuals construct meaning through social interactions, including the labels (e.g., "student") that shape behavior and identity. While Critical Sociology and Feminist Theory address broader societal structures and gender dynamics, Functionalist Theory concentrates on the social functions of education. Symbolic Interactionism, however, directly examines the micro-level processes of label acquisition and socialization. 

**Answer:** D. Symbolic Interactionism
