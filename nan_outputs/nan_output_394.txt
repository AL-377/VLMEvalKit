Okay, let's see. The question is about identifying the abnormal fiber in Gomori trichrome staining. The options are hypoxia, mitochondrial disorder, polymyositis, or nemaline myopathy. The image shows a muscle biopsy with some fibers that are pinkish and have a striated pattern. 

First, I need to recall what each of these options implies. Hypoxia is low oxygen, which can cause muscle fibers to become smaller and more darkly stained, but I don't think that's the case here. The fibers in the image are blue, which might indicate normal staining, but the pinkish ones are a different color. Maybe hypoxia isn't the right answer.

Mitochondrial disorders often show ragged red fibers in Masson's trichrome stain, but I'm not sure if that's the same as Gomori trichrome. Alternatively, mitochondrial disorders might cause fiber atrophy and mitochondrial accumulation, but again, I'm not certain. The image shows some fibers with a pinkish hue, which might not be typical of mitochondrial disorders.

Polymyositis is an inflammatory myopathy, which usually shows perifascicular atrophy, fiber necrosis, and inflammation. The image doesn't show inflammation or necrosis, so maybe that's not it.

Nemaline myopathy is a genetic disorder characterized by nemaline rods or fibers in the muscle. Gomori trichrome stain is often used to visualize nemaline rods because they appear as pinkish granules or rods. The image shows some fibers with a pinkish, striated appearance, which matches nemaline rods. Nemaline rods are filamentous structures composed of actin and other proteins, which would appear as these pinkish granules in the muscle fibers.

So, putting it all together, the abnormal fiber in Gomori trichrome staining here is typical of nemaline myopathy. The pinkish, striated appearance is characteristic of nemaline rods. The other options don't fit as well. Hypoxia would likely cause atrophy and dark staining, mitochondrial disorders might have different staining patterns, and polymyositis doesn't show the specific pinkish rods.

The abnormal fiber observed in Gomori trichrome staining is characterized by a pinkish, striated appearance, which is typical of **nemaline myopathy**. Nemaline rods, filamentous structures composed of actin and other proteins, appear as these pinkish granules in muscle fibers. Hypoxia, mitochondrial disorders, and polymyositis do not exhibit this specific staining pattern. 

**Answer:** D. Nemaline myopathy
