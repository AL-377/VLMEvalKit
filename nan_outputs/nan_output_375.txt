Okay, let's see. The question is asking about a color scheme that combines white, gray, black, or beige with one other color as an accent. The options are Monochromatic, Complementary, Analogous, or Accented Neutral. 

First, I need to recall what each of these color schemes entails. 

Monochromatic means using different shades of the same color. But here, the base colors are white, gray, black, or beige. If they were all the same color, like different grays, that would be monochromatic. But the question says "combines white, gray, black, or beige with ONE other color as an accent." So maybe it's not monochromatic because it includes multiple neutral colors plus one accent. 

Complementary color scheme is when you use colors that are opposite on the color wheel. For example, red and green. But here, the base colors are neutral, so maybe not complementary. 

Analogous is when you use colors that are next to each other on the color wheel, like blue, green, and yellow. Again, not sure if that fits here. 

Accented Neutral Color Scheme sounds like the answer. Because the main colors are neutral (white, gray, black, beige), and then there's one accent color. That's exactly what the question is describing. So the answer should be D.

The color scheme described combines neutral tones (white, gray, black, or beige) with one accent color, which aligns with the **Accented Neutral Color Scheme**. 

**Answer:** D. Accented Neutral Color Scheme
