Okay, so I need to figure out which of the two images was generated by AI. Let me look at both images carefully. 

The left image has a woman with a bright smile, wearing a yellow top and a colorful skirt. The background is a solid red color. The style seems a bit retro, maybe from the 1940s or 50s. The colors are vibrant, but there's a certain flatness to the image. The lighting is even, and the details in the clothing and hair are a bit soft, not too sharp. 

The right image shows another woman with a more serious expression. She's wearing a strapless purple dress with white trim. The background is a gradient of yellow and green. The lighting here is more dramatic, with shadows on her face and a strong light source from the left. The colors are more saturated, and the details in her hair and dress are sharper. The overall look is more polished and maybe even a bit stylized.

Now, considering AI-generated images, sometimes they can have a certain uniformity or lack of texture. The left image might have more texture in the clothing and hair, but the colors are a bit flat. The right image has more contrast and sharpness, which is often a characteristic of AI-generated art. However, it's also possible that a skilled artist could create a similar image. But in terms of AI generation, the right image might have more of the typical AI artifacts like smooth gradients or lack of fine details. 

Wait, but how do I know? Maybe I should think about the style. The left image has a more painterly quality, with softer edges and less defined features. The right image is more like a photograph or a highly stylized painting with sharp edges and defined details. AI-generated images often have a certain uniformity in color and texture. The right image's background gradient and the way the light interacts with the subject might be more typical of AI-generated images. 

Alternatively, maybe the left image is a classic illustration, and the right is an AI-generated version. But I need to be careful. Another thought: the right image's color saturation and contrast are very high, which might be a sign of AI processing. Also, the way the shadows are cast and the highlights on the dress could be more precise, which AI might handle better. 

But I'm not entirely sure. Maybe I should consider the options given. The options are A, B, C, D. C says both, which is unlikely. D says neither, but maybe one is AI. The question is which one was generated by AI. If I have to choose between A and B, which one is more likely. 

Alternatively, maybe both are AI-generated, but the question is which one was generated by AI. If I have to pick one, perhaps the right one. But I need to be more precise. Let me think again. The left image has a more traditional illustration style, while the right has a more modern, perhaps AI-generated look. But I might be overcomplicating it. 

Wait, the left image's background is a solid red, which is common in old advertisements or portraits. The right image has a gradient background, which is more modern. The right image's lighting is more dramatic, which could be a clue. Also, the texture in the right image's hair and dress seems more uniform, which might be AI-generated. 

Alternatively, maybe the left image is a real photograph that's been edited, and the right is AI-generated. But I can't be sure. However, given the options, and considering that the right image has more modern elements like the gradient background and the sharpness, I might lean towards the right image being AI-generated. 

But I'm not 100% certain. Maybe I should check the details again. The left image's colors are a bit muted, and the edges are softer. The right image has more contrast and defined edges. Also, the way the light interacts with the subject in the right image is more dynamic. 

Alternatively, maybe both are AI-generated, but the question is which one was generated by AI. If I have to choose between A and B, and considering that the right image has more modern characteristics, I think the answer is B. But I'm not entirely sure. Maybe I should look for any visible artifacts or inconsistencies. 

Alternatively, maybe the left image is a real photograph that's been colorized, and the right is AI-generated. But without more context, it's hard to tell. However, given the options, and the fact that the right image has more stylized elements, I think the answer is B. The right image.

The right image exhibits characteristics commonly associated with AI-generated art, such as high contrast, sharp edges, and uniform color gradients. The left image, while vibrant, has a more traditional illustration style with softer edges and less defined details. 

**Answer:** B. The right one.
