Okay, let's see. The question is asking which term refers to the choices a writer makes, including the combination of distinctive features like mood, voice, or word choice. The options are Theme, Setting, Style, and Tone.

First, I need to recall what each of these terms means. Let's start with the definitions. 

- **Theme** is the central message or idea of a work. It's about the main idea or the underlying meaning. So if someone says the theme is love, that's the main point they're trying to convey. But the question is about the writer's choices, not the main idea. So Theme might not be the right answer here.

- **Setting** refers to the time and place where the story takes place. It's the environment, including physical location, time period, and social setting. For example, a story set in a castle in the Middle Ages. So Setting is about where the story happens, not the writer's choices. So that's probably not it either.

- **Style** is about the way the writer uses language. It includes things like sentence structure, word choice, and the overall tone. So if a writer uses a lot of formal language or colloquial expressions, that's part of their style. Style encompasses the distinctive features like mood, voice, and word choice. That seems to fit.

- **Tone** is the attitude or emotional quality of the writing. It's how the writer feels about the subject, like being sarcastic, serious, or playful. So tone is more about the emotional impact rather than the writer's overall approach. While tone is part of style, it's a specific aspect, not the entire set of choices.

So putting it all together. The question is about the writer's choices that make their work unique. Style includes mood, voice, word choice, sentence structure, etc. Tone is a part of style but not the whole. Setting is about the location, and theme is the main idea. Therefore, the correct answer should be Style.

The term that refers to a writer's choices, including distinctive features like mood, voice, or word choice, is **Style**. While tone is a component of style, style encompasses the broader range of linguistic and structural choices that define an author's unique voice. 

**Answer:** C. Style
