Okay, so I need to figure out if these two beetles are pests of potatoes. Let me start by looking at the images. Both beetles have stripes, but the one on the left has black antennae and the one on the right has tan or reddish antennae. The question is asking if either or both are harmful to potatoes.

First, I remember that the Colorado potato beetle is a well-known pest of potatoes. It's a striped beetle with black antennae, right? The one on the left looks similar to that. The Colorado potato beetle is a major pest in potato fields, feeding on potato leaves and stems. They can cause significant damage, especially in large numbers. The one on the right has tan antennae and a different color pattern. Maybe that's a different species?

Wait, the question mentions that the Colorado potato beetle is crucial for potato production, but this isn't related to plant diseases. So maybe the Colorado potato beetle is considered a pest here, but the other one isn't. Let me think. The Colorado potato beetle is definitely a pest. The other one might be a harmless species. But I need to confirm.

I recall that the Colorado potato beetle has a distinctive black and yellow or orange coloration with black antennae. The one on the left matches that description. The one on the right has tan antennae and a different pattern. Maybe it's a different species, like the Mexican bean beetle or another type of beetle. The Mexican bean beetle is another pest, but it's not specifically a potato pest. However, some other beetles might be harmless.

But the question is about potatoes. The Colorado potato beetle is a major pest, so if the left one is that, then it's a pest. The right one might not be. But wait, the question says "either of these two insects, or maybe even both, are harmful to potatoes." So if both are harmful, then D is correct. If only one is, then B or C. But the Colorado potato beetle is definitely a pest. The other one might not be. Let me check the antennae color. The Colorado potato beetle has black antennae. The one on the left has black antennae, so that's the Colorado potato beetle. The other one has tan or reddish antennae. Maybe that's a different species, like the Mexican bean beetle, which is a pest of beans but not potatoes. So the Colorado potato beetle is a pest, but the other one isn't. Therefore, the answer would be B: The one with black coloured antennae, which is the Colorado potato beetle. But wait, the options are A. Neither, B. The one with black antennae, C. The one with tan antennae, D. Both. So if only the Colorado potato beetle is a pest, then B is correct. But the question says "either of these two insects, or maybe even both, are harmful to potatoes." So if both are pests, then D. But I need to verify.

Wait, the Colorado potato beetle is definitely a pest. The other one might not be. Let me think again. The Colorado potato beetle has black antennae and is a major pest. The other one has tan antennae. Maybe it's a harmless species. So the Colorado potato beetle is a pest, so answer B. But the options are A. Neither, B. The one with black antennae, C. The one with tan antennae, D. Both. So if only the Colorado potato beetle is a pest, then B is correct. But the question says "either of these two insects, or maybe even both, are harmful to potatoes." So if both are pests, then D. But I need to check if the other beetle is a potato pest. If it's not, then only B is correct. Let me confirm. The Colorado potato beetle is the one with black antennae. The other one is probably harmless. So the answer is B.

The Colorado potato beetle, identifiable by its black antennae and distinctive coloration, is a well-documented pest of potatoes. The beetle on the left matches this description and is harmful. The beetle on the right has tan antennae and a different pattern, which may belong to a harmless species. Since only the Colorado potato beetle is a potato pest, the correct answer is:

**B. The one with black coloured antennae**
