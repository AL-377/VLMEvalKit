Okay, let's see. The question is about the term that refers to the two boards that make a book more durable and allow it to stand on a shelf. The options are A. Hates, B. Motif, C. Drifts, D. Covers. Hmm, I need to think about the parts of a book.

First, I remember that a book has several parts. The cover is the outer part, right? But the cover itself is just the front and back boards. The spine is the part that connects the boards. So the two boards that make the book durable and let it stand are the front and back covers. So the answer should be D. Covers. Let me check the options again. A is Hates, which doesn't make sense. B is Motif, which is a design element. C is Drifts, which I don't think is related. D is Covers. Yeah, that's it. The two boards are the covers. So the answer is D.

The term referring to the two boards that make a book durable and allow it to stand on a shelf is the **covers**. These are the front and back boards of the book, which protect the pages and enable the book to remain upright. 

**Answer:** D. Covers
