Okay, so I need to figure out how a decrease in pH outside the cell affects the transport of amino acids into the cell. Let me start by recalling what I know about transport mechanisms. The diagram shows glucose and sodium ions moving across the membrane. There are two types of transport here: passive diffusion for glucose and active transport for sodium. 

Wait, the sodium ions are moving against their concentration gradient, which suggests active transport. That makes sense because active transport requires energy, usually from ATP, and moves substances against their concentration gradient. The glucose is moving with the concentration gradient, so it's passive diffusion. 

Now, the question is about amino acids. Amino acids are usually transported via active transport mechanisms, right? Like, the sodium-glucose cotransporters (SGLT1) in the intestines and kidneys use sodium ions to move glucose and other amino acids. So maybe this diagram is showing a similar mechanism. 

If the pH outside the cell decreases, that means the extracellular fluid becomes more acidic. How does pH affect the function of transport proteins? pH can affect the ionization state of amino acids and the structure of proteins. For example, if the pH is too low or too high, the proteins might denature, losing their structure and function. 

In the case of sodium-glucose cotransporters, these proteins are ion channels or carriers that rely on the sodium gradient to move glucose. If the extracellular pH decreases, making the environment more acidic, the sodium ions might not be able to cross the membrane as effectively. Sodium ions are crucial for maintaining the concentration gradient that drives the cotransport. If the extracellular pH is lower, maybe the sodium ions are less available or their movement is hindered. 

Alternatively, the acidic environment could affect the structure of the transport proteins. For instance, if the pH is too low, the proteins might protonate certain amino acid residues, which could disrupt their ability to bind or transport substrates. This would reduce the efficiency of the transport process. 

So, if the sodium ions are less available or the transport proteins are less functional due to the acidic pH, the amount of glucose (and amino acids) transported into the cell would decrease. Therefore, the answer should be B. decrease.

The decrease in extracellular pH (acidosis) would impair the sodium-glucose cotransport mechanism, as sodium ions are critical for maintaining the concentration gradient driving glucose (and amino acid) uptake. Acidic conditions may reduce sodium ion availability or disrupt the structure of transport proteins, lowering their efficiency. Thus, the amount of amino acids transported into the cell would **decrease**. 

**Answer:** B. decrease
