Okay, so I need to figure out what type of cellular transport is happening here. Let me start by recalling what I know about active and passive transport. 

Passive transport doesn't require energy and usually moves molecules from an area of higher concentration to lower concentration, right? Like diffusion or facilitated diffusion. On the other hand, active transport uses energy, usually ATP, to move molecules against their concentration gradient, from low to high concentration.

Looking at the diagram, the material is moving from the inside of the cell to the outside. The cell membrane has a protein channel involved. The arrows show the direction of movement. The black dots represent the molecules, and the white circles are the cell membrane and the channel protein.

Now, if the molecules are moving from inside to outside, that's from a higher concentration (inside) to a lower concentration (outside). Passive transport would be moving down the concentration gradient, which is what's happening here. But wait, the question is asking if it's active or passive. So even though it's moving from high to low concentration, the presence of a protein channel might indicate something else.

Wait, but the question is about the type of transport. Passive transport can be either simple diffusion or facilitated diffusion. Simple diffusion doesn't require a channel, but here there's a protein channel. So that must be facilitated diffusion. Facilitated diffusion is passive because it doesn't require energy, but it uses a channel protein to move molecules from high to low concentration.

So, if the molecules are moving from inside to outside (higher to lower concentration), that's passive transport. The answer should be D: Passive transport because molecules are moving toward equilibrium. Wait, but equilibrium is when concentrations are equal. If they're moving from high to low, that's moving toward equilibrium. So yes, D makes sense.

But let me double-check. The options are:

A. Active because moving away from equilibrium.

B. Active because moving toward equilibrium.

C. Passive because moving away from equilibrium.

D. Passive because moving toward equilibrium.

Since the molecules are moving from inside (higher concentration) to outside (lower concentration), they're moving toward equilibrium. Therefore, passive transport (D) is the correct answer. The presence of the protein channel is facilitated diffusion, which is passive. So the answer is D.

The diagram illustrates the movement of molecules from the cell interior to the exterior, facilitated by a protein channel. Since the molecules are transitioning from a region of higher concentration (inside the cell) to a lower concentration (outside), this movement aligns with passive transport, which occurs without energy expenditure. Facilitated diffusion, a type of passive transport, uses channel proteins to move molecules down their concentration gradient. Therefore, the correct answer is:

**D. Passive transport because molecules are moving toward equilibrium**
