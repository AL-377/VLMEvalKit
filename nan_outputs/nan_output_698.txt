Okay, let's try to figure out this problem. So, the question is whether the information from the three emails supports the inference that the legislative consultant will actively lobby Asian-American legislators because E.A.S.Y.'s supported candidates were more successful with Asian-Americans than with other minority groups. The options are A. Yes or B. No.

First, I need to understand what each email says and then see if the data in the graph (which is part of Email #2) supports the inference.

Starting with Email #1: The Vice President is concerned because their supported candidates lost in more than two-thirds of the races they followed. This makes it harder to get beneficial policies through the legislature and also a budget issue. They can't keep investing money in races they can't win, even if the candidates share their viewpoints. So they need to figure out where to invest.

Email #2: The Legislative Consultant responds by analyzing the demographic breakdown of elections where they supported unsuccessful candidates. They found that they've only won in one demographic, and their margin there is smaller than the others. The graph shows that for opponents (the candidates they supported lost to), the percentages for White voters, African-American voters, Hispanic voters, and Other (Asian, Pacific Islander) are 40%, 90%, 70%, and 70% respectively. For their own candidates, the percentages are 60% for White voters, and 28% for African-American, Hispanic, and Other.

Email #3: The Staff Researcher adds that the demographic groups they lost to are projected to become a majority by midcentury. Currently, they make up 37% of the population and 28% of voters. By 2050, the Hispanic population is expected to rise from 17% to 29%, and Asian-Americans from 5% to 9%. Non-Hispanic whites are declining from 63% to less than half. The one successful demographic (White voters) is the one whose share is declining.

Now, the statement to evaluate is: The legislative consultant will actively lobby Asian-American legislators because E.A.S.Y.'s supported candidates were more successful with Asian-Americans than with other minority groups.

So, the key here is to compare the success rates of E.A.S.Y.'s candidates with Asian-Americans versus other minority groups. The graph in Email #2 shows that for opponents (the candidates they lost to), Asian-Americans (labeled as "Other" in the graph) had 70% support. For their own candidates, Asian-Americans had 28% support. So, opponents had higher support from Asian-Americans than their own candidates. That suggests that Asian-Americans are a demographic where their opponents (the candidates they lost to) performed better. 

But the inference is that they will lobby Asian-American legislators. If the legislative consultant is trying to find where their candidates can win, they might look for demographics where their own candidates performed better. However, the data shows that their own candidates only performed better in White voters, and worse in all other demographics. So, if they want to invest where they can win, they might focus on White voters, but the problem is that White voters are a demographic whose share is declining. 

But the statement says they will lobby Asian-American legislators because their candidates were more successful with Asian-Americans. But according to the data, their own candidates were less successful with Asian-Americans (28%) than with opponents (70%). So, if they want to invest where they can win, they should focus on the demographics where their own candidates performed better, which is only White voters. However, the problem is that White voters are a declining demographic. 

But the statement is about lobbying Asian-American legislators. If the legislative consultant is trying to find where they can win, they might look for demographics where their own candidates performed better. But according to the data, their own candidates performed worse with Asian-Americans. Therefore, the inference that they will lobby Asian-American legislators because their candidates were more successful there doesn't hold. Instead, they might focus on other demographics where their own candidates performed better, even if those demographics are declining. 

But the problem is that the statement is making a causal inference: because their candidates were more successful with Asian-Americans (70% vs. 28%), they will lobby Asian-American legislators. But the data actually shows the opposite: their own candidates performed worse with Asian-Americans. Therefore, the inference is incorrect. 

Wait, but the graph shows that opponents (the candidates they lost to) had 70% support from Asian-Americans, while their own candidates had 28%. So, opponents performed better with Asian-Americans. Therefore, if the legislative consultant is trying to find where their candidates can win, they should focus on the demographics where their own candidates performed better, which is only White voters. But since White voters are declining, they might have to look elsewhere. However, the statement is suggesting they will lobby Asian-American legislators because their own candidates were more successful there. But the data shows the opposite: opponents were more successful with Asian-Americans. 

Therefore, the inference is incorrect. The legislative consultant would likely focus on White voters, even though they are declining, because that's the only demographic where their own candidates performed better. But the statement says they will lobby Asian-Americans because their own candidates were more successful there. Since the data shows the opposite, the answer should be B. No.

The information in the three emails does **not** support the inference that the legislative consultant will actively lobby Asian-American legislators because E.A.S.Y.'s supported candidates were more successful with Asian-Americans than with other minority groups. Here's the breakdown:

1. **Email #2 Analysis**: The graph shows that opponents (candidates E.A.S.Y. lost to) received **70% support** from Asian-American voters, while E.A.S.Y.'s own candidates only received **28%**. This indicates opponents performed better with Asian-Americans, not E.A.S.Y.'s candidates.

2. **Email #3 Context**: Projected demographic shifts suggest Asian-Americans are growing, but E.A.S.Y. needs to invest where they can win. Their own candidates performed worse with Asian-Americans than with other groups. Thus, focusing on White voters (a declining demographic) is more strategic, even if less politically viable.

3. **Inference Evaluation**: The statement incorrectly assumes E.A.S.Y. will lobby Asian-Americans because their candidates were more successful there. However, the data shows the opposite: opponents excelled with Asian-Americans. The inference lacks empirical support.

**Answer**: B. No
