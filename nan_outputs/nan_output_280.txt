Okay, let's try to figure out this ECG rhythm. First, I need to recall what each option represents. The options are sinus rhythm with PACs, junctional rhythm, second-degree AV block type I, third-degree AV block, normal sinus with PVCs, and idioventricular rhythm. 

Looking at the ECG, the first thing I notice is the P waves. In sinus rhythm, the P waves are usually regular and have a normal shape. But here, the P waves seem irregular. Also, the PR interval is variable, which is a key feature of second-degree AV block, type I (Wenckebach). In type I block, the PR interval progressively lengthens until a dropped beat occurs. 

Let me check the PR intervals. The first few beats have a normal PR interval, then the next one is longer, then even longer, and then there's a dropped beat. That fits with Wenckebach. The P waves are irregular, which could be due to the dropped beat. The QRS complexes are narrow, which is good because wide QRS would suggest ventricular origin. The R-R intervals are irregular, which is consistent with AV block. 

So, the answer is probably C. 2nd Degree AV Block, Type I. Let me double-check. The irregular P waves, variable PR intervals leading to a dropped beatâ€”yes, that's Wenckebach. The narrow QRS excludes idioventricular rhythm (which has wide QRS). Sinus with PACs would have regular P waves, but here they're irregular. Junctional rhythm has regular P waves, but the PR interval is fixed. Third-degree AV block has no P waves, which isn't the case here. PVCs would have wide QRS, but here they're narrow. So yes, C seems correct.

The ECG shows irregular P waves with a variable PR interval that progressively lengthens until a dropped beat occurs. This pattern is characteristic of **2nd-degree AV block, Type I (Wenckebach)**. The narrow QRS complexes exclude idioventricular rhythm, and the irregular P waves rule out sinus rhythm with PACs. Junctional rhythm has regular P waves, and third-degree AV block lacks P waves. 

**Answer:** C. 2nd Degree AV Block, Type I
