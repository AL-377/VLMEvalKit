Okay, let's try to figure out this problem. So, Jeff is trying to train his cats using behaviorism principles. The question is about Whiskers suddenly becoming ultra-aggressive after Jeff stops giving treats during playtime. We need to choose the best description from the options given.

First, let me recall what each option means. 

Option A says Whiskers only responds to continuous reinforcement. Continuous reinforcement means that every time the behavior is performed, the reward is given. So if Jeff was giving treats every time Whiskers played nicely, that's continuous reinforcement. But the problem states that Jeff stopped giving treats altogether. If Whiskers was only trained with continuous reinforcement, stopping the treats would mean no reinforcement, right? But the problem says Whiskers became ultra-aggressive. So maybe A isn't the answer because if he only used continuous reinforcement, stopping it would lead to extinction, but the behavior might not necessarily be aggressive. Maybe A is not the best fit.

Option B says Whisker's aggressive behavior has become generalized. Generalization means that the behavior spreads to similar situations. But the problem says Jeff stopped giving treats during playtime. If the aggressive behavior is generalized, it might be happening in other contexts, but the problem mentions it's happening when playing with the laser pointer. So maybe B isn't the answer.

Option C says Whiskers' behavior has been shaped to be aggressive. Shaping involves reinforcing successive approximations of the desired behavior. If Jeff was gradually increasing the number of times Whiskers had to play nicely before getting a treat, that's positive reinforcement. But if he stopped giving treats altogether, the behavior might extinguish. But the problem says he stopped giving treats, and Whiskers became aggressive. If the behavior was shaped, maybe the aggressive behavior was a result of the shaping process? Not sure. Maybe C is possible, but let's check D.

Option D says Whiskers is experiencing an extinction burst. Extinction burst is when a behavior that was previously reinforced suddenly becomes more frequent when the reinforcement is removed. For example, if a dog is trained with reinforcement and then the reinforcement is stopped, the dog might bark more. So in this case, if Whiskers was being reinforced for non-aggressive play, and then Jeff stopped reinforcing it, Whiskers might suddenly become aggressive. That sounds like an extinction burst. So D seems plausible.

Let me verify. Extinction burst occurs when the behavior is no longer reinforced, and the animal might exhibit more of the behavior before it extinguishes. So if Jeff was giving treats for non-aggressive play, and then stops, Whiskers might have an extinction burst, leading to more aggressive behavior. That makes sense. So D is the correct answer.

The other options don't fit as well. A is about continuous reinforcement, which isn't the case here. B is about generalization, which isn't mentioned. C is about shaping, which might be part of the training, but the problem is about stopping reinforcement leading to aggression. So D is the best answer.

Jeff stopped giving treats during playtime, leading Whiskers to become ultra-aggressive. This scenario aligns with **extinction burst**, where a behavior that was previously reinforced (non-aggressive play) becomes more frequent when reinforcement is removed. 

**Answer:** D. Whiskers is experiencing an extinction burst.
