Okay, let's try to figure out this problem. So, the question is about whether a worker would choose to work or enjoy leisure time in Case 1, which is labeled as "Low (work) income." The graph shows two indifference curves, IC1 and IC2, with the vertical axis representing income and the horizontal axis representing leisure time. The total time available is 24 hours, split between work and leisure.

First, I need to recall that in economics, indifference curves represent combinations of goods (here, income and leisure) that give the same level of utility. The higher the indifference curve, the higher the utility. So, the worker will choose the combination of income and leisure that lies on the highest possible indifference curve.

In this case, the two curves intersect at point a and point b. The question is asking which leisure time option (24 hours, 12 hours, or 8 hours) the worker would choose. The options are A, B, and C corresponding to these times.

Looking at the graph, point a is where IC1 and IC2 intersect. Since IC2 is higher than IC1, point a must be on IC2. Therefore, the worker would prefer point a over point b. But wait, point a is at 12 hours of leisure time. So, the worker would choose 12 hours of leisure time, which is option B.

But let me double-check. The vertical axis is income, and the horizontal axis is leisure time. The total time is 24 hours. If the worker chooses 12 hours of leisure, that leaves 12 hours for work. But in the graph, the indifference curves are drawn such that higher leisure time (closer to the vertical axis) gives higher income. Wait, no, actually, higher income is on the vertical axis. So, higher on the vertical axis is more income, which is good. Higher on the horizontal axis is more leisure time, which is also good. So, the worker wants to maximize both income and leisure time.

But the curves are drawn such that IC2 is above IC1, meaning that the worker prefers IC2 over IC1. The intersection points are a and b. Point a is on IC2 and has 12 hours of leisure time. Point b is on IC1 and has 24 hours of leisure time. Since IC2 is higher, the worker would choose point a, which is 12 hours of leisure. Therefore, the correct answer should be B. Leisure time is 12 hours.

But wait, the options are A (24), B (12), C (8). So, the answer is B. But let me make sure I'm not confusing leisure time with work time. The horizontal axis is leisure time, so 24 hours of leisure would mean 0 hours of work, and vice versa. So, point a is 12 hours leisure and 12 hours work, point b is 24 hours leisure and 0 hours work. Since IC2 is higher, the worker would choose point a, which is 12 hours leisure. Therefore, the answer is B.

The worker would choose the combination of income and leisure time that lies on the highest indifference curve (IC2). In the graph, point **a** (12 hours of leisure) is on IC2, while point **b** (24 hours of leisure) is on IC1. Since IC2 represents higher utility, the worker prefers **12 hours of leisure time**. 

**Answer:** B. Leisure time is 12 hours.
