Okay, let's try to figure out this question. So, the patient is a 49-year-old man with chest pain, EKG showing ST elevation, and cardiac troponin of 10 ng/mL. The gross appearance of his heart is shown in the image. The options are liquefactive necrosis, caseous necrosis, coagulative necrosis, or wet gangrene. 

First, I need to recall what each type of necrosis looks like. Liquefactive necrosis is when the dead tissue breaks down into a liquid, like in the brain after a stroke. Caseous necrosis is like a cheese-like, granular material, often seen in tuberculosis. Coagulative necrosis is when the dead tissue clumps together, like in a solid mass, common in heart attacks. Wet gangrene is when the dead tissue is wet and has a foul smell, often in limbs due to poor circulation.

The patient has ST elevation on EKG and high troponin, which are classic signs of a myocardial infarction (heart attack). The gross appearance of the heart in the image shows a large, pale area in the left ventricle. That's typical of a heart attack, where the infarcted area (necrosis) is pale and has a well-defined border. 

Liquefactive necrosis is more common in the brain, so that's probably not the case here. Caseous necrosis is more associated with tuberculosis, which isn't indicated here. Coagulative necrosis fits because the dead tissue clumps together, forming a solid mass. Wet gangrene is more about tissue that's gangrenous due to poor blood flow, which might be possible, but the question is about the gross appearance of the disease process. 

So, the most likely answer is coagulative necrosis. The image shows a well-defined, pale area in the heart muscle, which is characteristic of coagulative necrosis in a heart attack. The other options don't fit the clinical presentation or the gross appearance shown.

The patient's clinical presentation (ST elevation, high troponin) and gross heart appearance (well-defined pale area) are consistent with a myocardial infarction (heart attack). Coagulative necrosis, where dead tissue clumps together, is the hallmark of myocardial infarction. Liquefactive necrosis (brain), caseous necrosis (tuberculosis), and wet gangrene (poor circulation) do not match the described scenario. 

**Answer:** C. Coagulative necrosis
