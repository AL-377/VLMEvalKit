Okay, so I need to figure out which book inspired Evelyn De Morgan's painting. The painting shows five mermaids in the ocean, each with long hair and human upper bodies but fish tails. The options are four books: A. The Water Babies, B. The Little Mermaid, C. Around the World in 80 Days, D. Moby-Dick.

First, I should recall each book's content. The Water Babies by Charles Kingsley is a children's book about a boy who becomes a water baby and learns to swim. The Little Mermaid by Hans Christian Andersen is the classic fairy tale about a mermaid who wants to be human. Around the World in 80 Days is a travel adventure by Jules Verne. Moby-Dick is a classic novel about a whaling captain.

Now, looking at the painting. The mermaids are depicted in a naturalistic style, with realistic human features and fish tails. The setting is the ocean, which is consistent with mermaid lore. The Little Mermaid story is about a mermaid who longs to be human, which fits the painting's theme of transformation. The Water Babies is more about a boy's adventures in the sea, which might not directly relate to mermaids. Around the World in 80 Days is about traveling, not mermaids. Moby-Dick is about a whale, not mermaids either.

But wait, the Little Mermaid is a well-known fairy tale that has been adapted into various forms, including paintings. Evelyn De Morgan was a Pre-Raphaelite artist, known for her mythological and allegorical works. The painting here shows five mermaids, which might be a reference to the Little Mermaid's story, where she is the youngest of five sisters. Alternatively, maybe it's a different interpretation.

Alternatively, The Water Babies has mermaids as well. In the book, the water babies are described as mermaids. The main character, Tom, becomes a water baby and meets other mermaids. So maybe the painting is inspired by that. But the Little Mermaid is more directly about a single mermaid's desire to be human.

But the painting here has five mermaids, which could be a nod to the Little Mermaid's sisters. Alternatively, it might be a different story. However, given that the Little Mermaid is a classic fairy tale with a strong narrative about a mermaid, and the painting's style aligns with the romanticism of the Pre-Raphaelites, which often drew inspiration from literature, especially fairy tales and mythology, I think the answer is likely B. The Little Mermaid by Hans Christian Andersen.

Wait, but I should check if any of the other options could be a possibility. The Water Babies does have mermaids, but the main focus is on Tom's adventures. The Little Mermaid is more about the main character's journey. The other two books are not about mermaids at all. So yes, the Little Mermaid seems the most likely answer.

The painting depicts five mermaids in a naturalistic style, aligning with the romanticism of Evelyn De Morgan's work. The Little Mermaid by Hans Christian Andersen (1836) is a classic fairy tale featuring a mermaid's quest for human form, which directly relates to the painting's central theme. While *The Water Babies* (1863) by Charles Kingsley involves mermaids, its focus is on a boy's adventures, not the transformation narrative. *Around the World in 80 Days* (1873) and *Moby-Dick* (1851) are unrelated to mermaids. 

**Answer:** B. The Little Mermaid by Hans Christian Andersen (1836)
