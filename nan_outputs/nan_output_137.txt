Okay, let's see. The question is about when lines meet to form an enclosed area, what is that called. The options are Space, Shape, Form, or Line. Hmm. First, I need to recall the elements of art. The image shows different elements: Line, Shape, Form, Space, Texture, Value, and Color. 

So, the question is about lines forming an enclosed area. Let's break it down. Lines are straight or curved marks. When lines meet, they can create shapes. For example, if you draw a square, the lines form the shape of a square. So, when lines meet to form an enclosed area, that's a shape. 

Looking at the options, B is Shape. The other options: Space is about the area around or between objects, Form is about three-dimensional shapes, and Line is the element itself. So, the correct answer should be B. Shape.

The elements of art include **Shape**, which is formed when lines meet to enclose an area.
