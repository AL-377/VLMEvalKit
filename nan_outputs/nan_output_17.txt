Okay, let's see. The question is about finding the conversion cost for Choco's Chocolates. The options are given, and I need to figure out which one is correct. 

First, I remember that conversion cost is a key concept in manufacturing accounting. It's the sum of direct labor and manufacturing overhead. Manufacturing overhead includes things like factory depreciation, utilities, and other indirect costs related to production. 

Looking at the provided costs, the direct materials are $15,000, direct labor is $25,000. Then there's factory depreciation expense of $45,000, factory utilities expense of $2,000, and payroll staff's salary of $15,000. 

Wait, the payroll staff's salary is under "Payroll staff's salary," which I think is part of the direct labor. Because direct labor includes both direct wages and salaries of production workers. So maybe that's already included in the direct labor amount of $25,000. Let me check that. 

So, direct labor is the cost of the people directly involved in making the product. That would include their wages and salaries. So if the payroll staff's salary is $15,000, that's part of the direct labor. Therefore, the $25,000 already includes that. So we don't need to add another $15,000 for that. 

So the conversion cost would be direct labor plus manufacturing overhead. Manufacturing overhead here is the sum of factory depreciation and factory utilities. Let's add those up: $45,000 (depreciation) + $2,000 (utilities) = $47,000. 

Then direct labor is $25,000. So total conversion cost is $25,000 + $47,000 = $72,000. 

Looking at the options, C is $72,000. So that should be the answer. Let me double-check. 

Wait, but maybe I made a mistake here. Let me go through again. 

Direct materials: $15,000. That's a cost of goods sold, not part of conversion cost. 

Direct labor: $25,000. That's part of conversion cost. 

Factory depreciation: $45,000. That's part of manufacturing overhead, which is part of conversion cost. 

Factory utilities: $2,000. Also part of manufacturing overhead. 

Payroll staff's salary: $15,000. If that's part of direct labor, then yes, already included in $25,000. So total conversion cost is direct labor ($25k) plus manufacturing overhead ($45k + $2k) = $72k. 

So the answer is C. $72,000. 

I think that's right. Let me check the options again. A is 52k, B is 62k, C is 72k, D is 82k. Yep, C is correct.

The conversion cost includes direct labor and manufacturing overhead. Direct labor is $25,000, and manufacturing overhead consists of factory depreciation ($45,000) and factory utilities ($2,000). Adding these together:  
\[
25,000 + 45,000 + 2,000 = 72,000
\]  
The payroll staff's salary is part of direct labor and already included in the $25,000. Direct materials are a cost of goods sold, not part of conversion cost.  

**Answer:** C. $72,000
