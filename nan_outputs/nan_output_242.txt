Okay, let's see. The question is asking to identify structure 164 in the section of the knee. The options are Ligamentum patellae, Fibular collateral ligament, Tibial collateral ligament, or Anterior cruciate ligament. 

First, I need to recall the anatomy of the knee joint. The knee has several ligaments that stabilize it. The cruciate ligaments are the anterior and posterior cruciate ligaments, which are located in the middle of the knee. The collateral ligaments are on the sides, the tibial collateral ligament on the inner side (medial) and the fibular collateral ligament on the outer side (lateral). The Ligamentum patellae is the patellar ligament, which connects the kneecap to the tibia.

Looking at the image, structure 164 is near the center of the knee joint. The cruciate ligaments are typically in the middle, so maybe 164 is one of them. The anterior cruciate ligament is anterior (front) to the posterior cruciate ligament. The posterior cruciate is more towards the back. 

In the image, structure 164 is located in the center, above the tibia. The anterior cruciate ligament is anterior to the posterior cruciate. So if 164 is anterior, that would be the anterior cruciate. The posterior cruciate would be below or behind, but the image shows a cross-section. Let me check the positions. The anterior cruciate is closer to the front, and the posterior is behind. So if 164 is in the front part of the knee joint, that's the anterior cruciate. 

The Ligamentum patellae is the patellar ligament, which connects the patella to the tibia. That's at the bottom of the image, not near the center. The collateral ligaments are on the sides. The tibial collateral ligament is on the inner side, and the fibular on the outer. So structure 164 is in the center, which is the cruciate ligaments. Since the anterior cruciate is anterior, and the posterior is posterior, and 164 is in the front part, that would be the anterior cruciate. 

So the answer should be D. Anterior cruciate ligament.

The structure labeled 164 in the knee cross-section is located in the central region of the joint. The cruciate ligaments are positioned here, with the anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) being anterior (front) to the posterior cruciate ligament (PCL). Since 164 is in the front part of the knee, it corresponds to the **Anterior cruciate ligament**. The Ligamentum patellae (patellar ligament) connects the patella to the tibia and is located at the bottom of the image, while the collateral ligaments are on the sides. 

**Answer:** D. Anterior cruciate ligament
