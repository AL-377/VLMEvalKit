Okay, so I need to figure out which famous figure this painting is depicting the death of. The options are Cimabue, Donatello, Giotto, or Brunelleschi. Let me start by recalling some information about each of these artists.

First, Cimabue was an Italian painter and a precursor to Giotto. He lived from around 1240 to 1302. Giotto was a bit later, from 1266 to 1337. Donatello was a sculptor, active from 1386 to 1466. Brunelleschi was an architect and engineer, known for his work on the dome of the Florence Cathedral, which started in 1420. So, the time periods here are important.

Now, the painting in question is by Frederic Leighton, as mentioned in the problem. The style of the painting looks somewhat Renaissance, with classical architecture and figures dressed in period clothing. The setting seems to be a town square or a public place, with a dome visible in the background, which might be a reference to Florence, where Brunelleschi worked.

The painting shows a figure lying on a bier, which is a type of coffin or bier used in funerals. The people around him are dressed in period attire, and there are children present, which is typical in Renaissance funerals. The architecture includes columns and a dome, which could be a reference to Brunelleschi's work on the Florence Cathedral. However, I need to check if there's a specific event related to Brunelleschi that would be depicted in a painting like this.

Cimabue and Giotto are both earlier artists, so their deaths might not be as well-documented in art. Donatello was a sculptor, so his death might not be as directly depicted in a painting. However, Brunelleschi was a prominent figure in the Renaissance, so his death might be more likely to be commemorated in art.

Looking at the options, the most plausible answer is Brunelleschi. The architecture in the painting, with the dome and columns, points to his work. Additionally, the Renaissance period would have been the time when such artistic depictions of deaths would be common. Cimabue and Giotto were more in the earlier medieval period, so their deaths might not be as celebrated in art. Donatello was a sculptor, so his death might not be as directly depicted in a painting. Therefore, the answer is likely D. Brunelleschi.

The painting depicts the death of **Brunelleschi**, a renowned Italian architect and engineer. The architectural elements, such as the dome and columns, reference his work on the Florence Cathedral. The Renaissance setting and classical style align with his era, making his death a fitting subject for artistic commemoration. 

**Answer:** D. Brunelleschi
