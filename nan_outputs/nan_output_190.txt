Okay, so I need to figure out what kind of tissue this image depicts. The options are Cardiac muscle, Skeletal muscle, or Cartilage. Let me start by recalling the characteristics of each type of muscle tissue.

First, Cardiac muscle. I remember that cardiac muscle is found in the heart. It has a distinctive appearance with striations, but they're not as regular as skeletal muscle. The cells are usually branched and have intercalated discs, which are junctions between cells. Also, cardiac muscle cells have a single nucleus, right? And they're involuntary, so they contract without conscious control.

Skeletal muscle, on the other hand, is the type you can control, like in your arms or legs. The fibers are long, cylindrical, and have regular, alternating light and dark bands (striations). Each cell has multiple nuclei, and they're arranged in parallel. Skeletal muscle is voluntary.

Cartilage is connective tissue that provides support and flexibility. It has cells called chondrocytes that are embedded in a matrix. The matrix can be hyaline, elastic, or fibrocartilage. Under a microscope, cartilage might show a more uniform appearance with cells in lacunae, and the matrix might appear more fibrous or glassy.

Looking at the image, the tissue has a pinkish hue, which is typical for stained sections. The cells are elongated and arranged in parallel, which is a key feature of skeletal muscle. Skeletal muscle fibers are striated, and each fiber has multiple nuclei. The nuclei are often located near the periphery of the cell, which is what I see here. The regular arrangement and the striations are consistent with skeletal muscle.

Cardiac muscle cells are more branched and have intercalated discs, which might not be visible at this magnification. Also, cardiac muscle cells have a single nucleus, but sometimes they can have multiple nuclei. However, the regularity of the cells and the striations here point more towards skeletal muscle.

Cartilage, when stained, can look a bit different. The cells are in lacunae, and the matrix might be more fibrous or glassy. The cells in cartilage are usually smaller and more rounded, which isn't what I see here. The tissue in the image has elongated cells, which is more characteristic of skeletal muscle.

So, putting it all together, the image shows elongated, parallel cells with multiple nuclei and regular striations, which are hallmarks of skeletal muscle. Therefore, the correct answer should be B. Skeletal muscle.

The image depicts tissue with elongated, parallel cells arranged in a regular pattern, each containing multiple nuclei. These features are characteristic of **skeletal muscle**. Cardiac muscle cells are branched and have intercalated discs, while cartilage cells are embedded in a matrix with lacunae. The uniform striations and cell structure align with skeletal muscle. 

**Answer:** B. Skeletal muscle
