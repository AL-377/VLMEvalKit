Okay, so I need to figure out in which decade this sculpture was created. The options are 1910s, 1940s, 1960s, or 1990s. Let me start by analyzing the image.

First, the sculpture looks abstract. It has geometric shapes, like cubes and rectangles, arranged in a way that's not immediately recognizable. The materials seem to be metal, maybe steel or iron, given the rust-like appearance. The structure is quite angular and modern in style. 

I remember that abstract art became popular in the early 20th century, especially after World War I. The 1910s were a time when artists like Picasso and Matisse were experimenting with abstract forms. However, the sculpture in the image seems more geometric and perhaps influenced by Cubism or Constructivism. 

Constructivism, which was popular in the 1920s and 1930s, often featured geometric shapes and industrial materials. The use of metal and the industrial look might align with that movement. But the 1940s are more associated with Post-War Modernism, which might have more organic shapes or different materials. 

Wait, the 1960s are known for Pop Art and Minimalism, which also use geometric shapes but in a different context. Minimalism often uses simple forms and industrial materials. However, the sculpture here seems more complex in structure. 

The 1990s might be too recent for this style. Maybe it's a more recent work, but the materials and style seem older. 

Let me think again. The use of metal and the geometric abstraction could point to the 1920s or 1930s. Constructivism was a key movement during that time. Artists like El Lissitzky and Naum Gabo were part of this. Gabo's work often used metal and geometric forms. 

Alternatively, maybe it's a later work. The 1960s had artists like Donald Judd, who used industrial materials and simple geometric forms. But Judd's work is more about space and the environment, whereas this sculpture seems more static. 

Alternatively, maybe it's a more recent work that's referencing earlier styles. But given the options, the 1960s seem plausible. 

Wait, the 1940s are associated with Abstract Expressionism, which is more about emotion and gestural painting. This sculpture is more geometric and three-dimensional. 

So, considering the options, the 1960s (C) or 1990s (D). The 1990s might be too modern, but the style here seems more in line with earlier movements. 

Alternatively, maybe the 1960s. Let me check some key artists. Richard Serra's work in the 1960s used metal and geometric forms, but his pieces are more about the viewer's interaction. This sculpture looks more like a static installation. 

Alternatively, maybe it's a work from the 1920s or 1930s. The materials and style seem older. 

Wait, the 1910s are when Cubism was popular, but this seems more Constructivist. 

Hmm. Maybe the answer is C. 1960s. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe it's a later work. 

Wait, the sculpture's style is quite angular and geometric, which could be from the 1960s. Let me think about key artists. 

In the 1960s, artists like Carl Andre were using metal and geometric forms. His work often involved placing metal sheets on the floor, creating geometric patterns. The sculpture in the image has a similar aesthetic. 

Alternatively, maybe it's a work by a lesser-known artist. But given the options, the 1960s seem the most likely. 

Alternatively, the 1940s. Let me think again. Abstract Expressionism is 1940s-1960s, but this is more geometric. 

Wait, maybe the 1990s. But the materials and style don't seem recent. 

Alternatively, the 1920s. 

I'm a bit confused. Let me try to recall key dates. 

Constructivism was active from the 1920s to the 1930s. Artists like El Lissitzky created geometric sculptures using metal and industrial materials. 

If this sculpture is similar to their work, then it's likely from the 1920s or 1930s. But the options don't have that. 

Alternatively, maybe it's a later work. The 1960s. 

Wait, the 1960s had artists like Donald Judd, who used metal and geometric forms, but his work is more about the space and the viewer's interaction. This sculpture seems more like a static installation. 

Alternatively, maybe it's a work by a modernist artist from the 1920s or 1930s. 

Given the options, I think the answer is C. 1960s. But I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, maybe it's a work from the 1990s. 

Wait, the 1990s had a lot of abstract art, but the style here seems more like earlier movements. 

Alternatively, maybe the 1940s. 

Hmm. Let me check some key points. 

If the sculpture is made of metal and has geometric shapes, it's possible it's from the 1960s. For example, Carl Andre's work in the 1960s used metal and geometric forms. 

Alternatively, maybe it's a work by a different artist. 

Alternatively, the 1920s. 

I think I need to make a decision. The options are 1910s, 1940s, 1960s, 1990s. 

Given the geometric abstraction and metal use, the 1960s (C) seems plausible. But I'm not entirely certain. 

Alternatively, maybe the 1990s. 

Wait, the 1990s had a lot of postmodern art, which might include more complex geometric structures. 

Alternatively, the 1920s. 

I think I need to go with the 1960s. So the answer is C.

The sculpture exhibits geometric abstraction and the use of industrial materials, characteristic of Constructivist art movements prevalent in the 1920s and 1930s. While later periods like the 1960s (Minimalism) or 1990s (Postmodernism) also featured geometric forms, the angular composition, industrial materials, and focus on geometric structure align more closely with Constructivism. Constructivism was a key movement in the 1920s and 1930s, emphasizing geometric shapes and industrial aesthetics. 

**Answer:** C. 1960's
