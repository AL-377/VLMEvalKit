Okay, let's see. The question is about which country prior to 1890 couldn't be depicted in a similar cartoon as the one shown here. The cartoon is labeled "The Devilfish in Egyptian Waters, 1882." The image shows a large octopus-like creature labeled "England" with multiple tentacles reaching out to various places like Egypt, India, Canada, and others. So, the style is a satirical political cartoon from the 19th century, likely depicting British imperial power.

The options are A. Netherlands, B. France, C. Belgium, D. Germany. The question is asking which of these countries couldn't be represented in a similar cartoon prior to 1890. So, we need to think about which of these countries didn't have significant colonies or imperial ambitions in the late 19th century.

First, let's recall the major European powers and their colonies around 1890. The British Empire was at its peak, with colonies all over the world. France had colonies in Africa, Asia, and the Caribbean. The Netherlands had colonies in the East Indies (Indonesia) and Suriname. Belgium, on the other hand, didn't have a significant empire. It was a small country with limited colonies, mostly in Africa. Germany, which was unifying around that time, was still a relatively young nation and hadn't yet expanded its empire much beyond its own territories.

So, the key here is which of these countries had established colonies by 1890. Let's break it down:

- **Netherlands**: By 1890, the Dutch East Indies (Indonesia) was a major colony, and they also had Suriname and other territories. So, they definitely had colonies.

- **France**: France had colonies in Africa (like Algeria, Senegal), Indochina (Vietnam, Laos, Cambodia), and the Caribbean (Martinique, Guadeloupe, etc.). So, France was a major imperial power.

- **Belgium**: Belgium's colonies were limited. They had the Congo Free State (which was actually a personal possession of King Leopold II) and a few other territories in Africa. So, Belgium's empire was much smaller compared to the others.

- **Germany**: Germany had colonies in Africa (like Togo, Cameroon, and parts of South West Africa) and the Pacific (New Guinea). However, these were established after 1890. The German Empire was formed in 1871, but it wasn't until the late 1880s and early 1890s that they started expanding their colonies. So, prior to 1890, Germany didn't have significant colonies. The cartoon in question is from 1882, so by that time, Germany hadn't yet established its colonies. Therefore, a similar cartoon depicting Germany's imperial ambitions wouldn't have been possible yet.

Therefore, the answer should be D. Germany. Because prior to 1890, Germany didn't have the colonies to be depicted in such a cartoon. The others (Netherlands, France, Belgium) all had colonies by that time.

The cartoon depicts the British Empire's global influence, with tentacles reaching into colonies like Egypt, India, and Canada. By 1890, the Netherlands, France, and Belgium had established significant colonies. However, Germany, though a rising power, had not yet expanded its empire beyond its own territories by that time. Thus, a similar cartoon highlighting Germany's imperial ambitions would not have been feasible prior to 1890.

**Answer:** D. Germany
