Okay, let's see. The question is asking for the one defining feature of a minority group. The options are A. Self-definition, B. Numerical minority, C. Lack of power, D. Strong cultural identity.

First, I need to recall what a minority group is. From the image provided, it says a minority group is a distinct group of people who lack the collective numbers to be protected from discrimination. So the key point here is the numerical aspect. They don't have enough people to be protected by the dominant group. 

Looking at the options, B is "Numerical minority." That seems to fit because the definition mentions lacking collective numbers. The other options: A is self-definition, which might relate to how they identify themselves, but that's more about their own perception rather than a defining feature of the group. C is lack of power, which could be a result of being a minority, but isn't the defining feature. D is strong cultural identity, which some minorities might have, but again, that's more about their characteristics rather than the defining feature.

So the correct answer should be B. Numerical minority. The image's definition explicitly states that they lack the numbers to be protected, which directly relates to being a numerical minority. The other options are either results of being a minority or not directly tied to the definition given.

The defining feature of a minority group, as per the provided definition, is their **lack of collective numbers** to be sufficiently protected from discrimination. This directly aligns with option **B. Numerical minority**. 

**Answer:** B. Numerical minority
