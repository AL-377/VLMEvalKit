Okay, let's see. The problem is about calculating the total cost per 800 clients for Sanchez & Vukmin, LLP. They provided tax preparation services to 500 clients last year. The fixed costs were $265,000, and variable costs were $180,000. The options are given, and I need to figure out which one is correct.

First, I remember that fixed costs don't change with the number of clients, right? So if they have 500 clients, those fixed costs are spread over 500 clients. Then variable costs would depend on the number of clients because they increase as more clients are served. So total costs would be fixed plus variable.

But the question is asking for the total cost per 800 clients. So maybe I need to find the total cost when they have 800 clients and then divide by 800 to get the per-client cost. Alternatively, maybe there's a way to calculate the cost per client first and then multiply by 800? Let me think.

Let me start by calculating the total cost per client for 500 clients. Total cost is fixed plus variable. Fixed is $265,000, variable is $180,000. So total cost is 265,000 + 180,000 = $445,000. Then total cost per client is 445,000 divided by 500. Let me compute that: 445,000 / 500. Hmm, 445,000 divided by 500. Well, 445,000 divided by 100 is 4,450. Then divided by 5 is 890. So 4,450 divided by 5 is 890. So total cost per client is $890.

Wait, but the question is asking for the total cost per 800 clients. So if each client costs $890, then total cost for 800 clients would be 800 * 890. Let me calculate that. 800 * 800 is 640,000. 800 * 90 is 72,000. So total is 640,000 + 72,000 = 712,000. So the total cost per 800 clients would be $712,000. Looking at the options, A is $712,000. So that should be the answer.

But let me double-check. Maybe there's another way to approach this. Let's see. If fixed costs are $265,000, which is spread over 500 clients, then fixed cost per client is 265,000 / 500 = 530. Then variable cost per client is 180,000 / 500 = 360. So total cost per client is 530 + 360 = 890. Then total cost for 800 clients is 800 * 890. Let me compute that again. 800 * 800 = 640,000. 800 * 90 = 72,000. 640,000 + 72,000 = 712,000. Yep, same result. So the answer is A.

Alternatively, maybe the question is asking for the total cost per client, but the options include total cost. Wait, the options are:

A. $712,000

B. $632,000

C. $288,000

D. $424,000

So if the question is total cost per 800 clients, then A is the answer. But let me check if there's a different interpretation. For example, maybe the question is asking for the total cost per client, but the options are given as total costs. Wait, the options are:

A. $712,000

B. $632,000

C. $288,000

D. $424,000

But the question says "total cost per 800 clients". So if the answer is $712,000, which is option A, then that's the correct one. So I think the answer is A.

But let me check again. Maybe there's a mistake in my calculation. Let's verify each step.

First, total cost for 500 clients: fixed $265,000 + variable $180,000 = $445,000. Correct. Then total cost per client: 445,000 / 500 = 890. Correct. Then total cost for 800 clients: 800 * 890. Let's compute 800 * 800 = 640,000. 800 * 90 = 72,000. 640,000 + 72,000 = 712,000. Yes, that's correct. So the answer is A. So I think that's the right choice.

To determine the total cost per 800 clients, first calculate the total cost for 500 clients:  
**Total cost = Fixed costs + Variable costs**  
= $265,000 + $180,000  
= **$445,000**  

Next, find the cost per client for 500 clients:  
**Cost per client = Total cost / Number of clients**  
= $445,000 / 500  
= **$890**  

Finally, compute the total cost for 800 clients:  
**Total cost for 800 clients = Cost per client × 800**  
= $890 × 800  
= **$712,000**  

**Answer:** A. $712,000
