Okay, so the question is whether we can add a DEPARTMENT record if there are no EMPLOYEEs in the database. Let me think through this step by step.

First, I need to recall the structure of the database as shown in the ER diagram. The main tables are EMPLOYEE, DEPARTMENT, DEPT_LOCATIONS, PROJECT, WORKS_ON, and DEPENDENT. Let's look at the relationships between these tables.

Starting with the DEPARTMENT table. It has attributes like Dname, Dnumber, Mgr_ssn, and Mgr_start_date. The key here is probably the Dnumber. Now, how does the DEPARTMENT table relate to other tables? The diagram shows that DEPARTMENT has a foreign key Dno in the EMPLOYEE table. Wait, the EMPLOYEE table has a Dno column, which is a foreign key referencing Dnumber in DEPARTMENT. So, each employee belongs to a department (Dno), and each department has a Dnumber.

But the question is about adding a DEPARTMENT record when there are no employees. Let's think about the constraints. If there are no employees, does that affect the DEPARTMENT table? Well, the DEPARTMENT table's Dnumber is a primary key, right? So each department must have a unique Dnumber. But if there are no employees, does that mean we can't have any DEPARTMENT records? Or can we have a DEPARTMENT record even if there are no employees?

Wait, the Dnumber in DEPARTMENT is a primary key. So if there are no employees, does that mean we can't have any DEPARTMENT records? Because the Dnumber would have to be unique, and if there are no employees, maybe there's no need for a DEPARTMENT. But the question is about adding a DEPARTMENT record. So if there are no employees, can we still add a DEPARTMENT record?

But the DEPARTMENT table's Dnumber is a primary key. So if we try to insert a DEPARTMENT record, we need to assign a Dnumber. However, if there are no employees, does that mean that Dnumber is unused? Or is there a requirement that each DEPARTMENT must have at least one employee?

Wait, the Dno in the EMPLOYEE table is a foreign key referencing Dnumber in DEPARTMENT. So each employee must belong to a department. Therefore, if there are no employees, there can be no DEPARTMENT records. Because if there's a DEPARTMENT, it would need at least one employee to reference it via Dno. But if there are no employees, then the DEPARTMENT table can't have any records because there's no way to reference them from the EMPLOYEE table.

Therefore, the answer would be B. No, because you can't add a DEPARTMENT record if there are no employees, because the DEPARTMENT table's Dnumber would have to reference an employee's Dno, which doesn't exist.

The key constraint here is the relationship between the EMPLOYEE and DEPARTMENT tables. The Dno in the EMPLOYEE table is a foreign key referencing Dnumber in DEPARTMENT. Since each employee must belong to a department (Dno), the DEPARTMENT table cannot exist without at least one employee. Adding a DEPARTMENT record would require a corresponding Dno in the EMPLOYEE table, which is impossible if there are no employees. 

**Answer:** B. No
