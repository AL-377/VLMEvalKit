Okay, let's see. The question is asking about a term that describes creating a sketch after reading a book to reflect on its significance or connections, then sharing it. The options are A. Fact Book Stretch, B. Sketch to Stretch, C. Science Fiction Stretch, D. Informational Picture Book.

First, I need to understand each option. Let's start with the description given. The practice involves reading a book, then sketching to reflect on the story's meaning or connections, and then sharing the sketch. So the key elements here are: reading a book, creating a sketch, reflecting, and sharing. 

Looking at the options, option B is "Sketch to Stretch." That seems to fit because "Sketch" relates to the drawing part, and "Stretch" might imply expanding or reflecting on the content. The other options don't seem to align as closely. 

Option A is "Fact Book Stretch." A fact book is a type of book, but the term "Stretch" here might not make sense. It's more about the type of book rather than the practice described. 

Option C is "Science Fiction Stretch." Science fiction is a genre, but again, the term "Stretch" here doesn't connect to the practice of sketching and reflecting. 

Option D is "Informational Picture Book." This is a type of book, not a practice. So D is probably not the answer. 

So, the best fit is B. Sketch to Stretch. The practice involves creating a sketch (drawing) to reflect on the book's significance (stretching out the understanding). The other options either don't relate to the practice or refer to different types of books.

The term that best describes the practice of creating a sketch after reading a book to reflect on its significance or connections and then sharing it is **B. Sketch to Stretch**. This option directly aligns with the described process, where "Sketch" refers to the drawing activity and "Stretch" signifies expanding or reflecting on the content. The other options either describe book types (A, C, D) or lack relevance to the described practice. 

**Answer:** B. Sketch to Stretch
