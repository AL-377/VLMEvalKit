Okay, let's see. The question is about finding the boiling point of a substance based on its heating curve. The options are A. 0°C, B. -50°C, C. 12°C, D. 75°C. Hmm. 

First, I need to recall what a heating curve looks like. Typically, a heating curve shows how temperature changes with the amount of heat added. The x-axis is usually heat added (in calories or kilocalories per mole), and the y-axis is temperature. The curve usually has different sections: heating the solid, melting the solid (constant temperature), heating the liquid, boiling (constant temperature), and then heating the gas. 

Looking at the graph provided, there are two horizontal lines. The first one is from the start (0 kcal/mol) up to around 2 kcal/mol, where the temperature increases from -50°C to about 12°C. Then there's another horizontal line from around 2 kcal/mol to 12 kcal/mol, where the temperature stays at 75°C. After that, the temperature starts increasing again. 

So, the first horizontal line is the melting process. The temperature remains constant during melting, which is the melting point. Then the second horizontal line is the boiling process, where the temperature remains constant during boiling, which is the boiling point. 

In the graph, the first horizontal line is from -50°C to 12°C, but wait, that can't be right. Wait, the first horizontal line is from the start (0 kcal/mol) to around 2 kcal/mol, and the temperature goes from -50°C to 12°C. Then the next horizontal line is from 2 kcal/mol to 12 kcal/mol, where the temperature is 75°C. 

Wait, that seems confusing. If the first horizontal line is from 0 kcal/mol to 2 kcal/mol, and the temperature goes from -50°C to 12°C, that would mean the substance is being heated from -50°C to 12°C, which is a temperature increase of 12 - (-50) = 62°C. But then the next horizontal line is from 2 kcal/mol to 12 kcal/mol, where the temperature is 75°C. That would mean the substance is melting and then boiling. 

But how does that work? Let me think. The heating curve starts at -50°C. When heat is added, the temperature increases until it reaches the melting point. Then, during melting, the temperature remains constant. After melting, the temperature continues to rise until it reaches the boiling point, where it stays constant. After that, it continues to rise. 

So, in the graph, the first horizontal line (from 0 to 2 kcal/mol) is the melting process. The temperature goes from -50°C to 12°C. Then, the next horizontal line (from 2 to 12 kcal/mol) is the boiling process, where the temperature is 75°C. So the boiling point is 75°C. 

But wait, the options include -50°C as an option. That's the initial temperature. The melting point would be the temperature at the start of the horizontal line, which is 12°C. Then the boiling point is 75°C. So the answer should be D. 75°C. 

But let me double-check. The first horizontal line is the melting process. The temperature at the start of the horizontal line is 12°C, which is the melting point. Then, after melting, the temperature rises to 75°C, which is the boiling point. So yes, the boiling point is 75°C. 

Therefore, the correct answer is D.

The heating curve shows two horizontal segments. The first horizontal line (from 0 to 2 kcal/mol) indicates the melting process, where the temperature remains constant at **12°C** (melting point). The second horizontal line (from 2 to 12 kcal/mol) represents the boiling process, where the temperature stays constant at **75°C** (boiling point). 

**Answer:** D. 75°C
