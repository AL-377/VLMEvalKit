Okay, let's see. The question is about drawing the influence line for any quantity value. The options are about the type of load assumed. The image shows a triangular shape with a plus sign in the middle, which might represent the influence line diagram for a specific quantity, like a bending moment or shear force. 

First, I need to recall what an influence line is. From what I remember, an influence line is a graph that shows the maximum value of a quantity (like shear force or bending moment) at a particular point in a structure due to a unit load moving along the structure. The key here is that the load is a unit load, right? So it's a single load that moves along the structure, and the influence line shows how the quantity changes as the load moves. 

Looking at the options: 

A. unit moving load with unchanged direction. Hmm, that sounds like a unit load that moves along the structure without changing direction. So it's a single load moving from one end to the other, and the influence line would show the maximum values at each point. 

B. moving load. Well, a moving load is any load that moves along the structure, but it's not necessarily a unit load. The influence line is usually for a unit load, so maybe this is a distractor. 

C. dynamic load. Dynamic loads are loads that vary over time, like wind or earthquake loads. The influence line is typically for static loads, so this might not be the right answer. 

D. movable load. Similar to B, a movable load is any load that can move, but again, the influence line is for a unit load. 

So, the correct answer should be A. Because an influence line is created by assuming a unit load moving along the structure with a fixed direction. The other options either don't specify a unit load (B and D) or refer to dynamic loads (C), which are not typically used for influence lines. 

Wait, but the image has a plus sign in the middle. Maybe that's a specific quantity's influence line, but regardless, the process is the same. The load is a unit load moving with unchanged direction. So yes, A is correct.

The influence line for a quantity value is constructed by assuming a **unit moving load** with a fixed direction. This load moves along the structure, and the influence line graphically represents the maximum values of the quantity at each point. The other options either describe non-unit loads (B and D) or dynamic loads (C), which are not relevant for influence lines. 

**Answer:** A. unit moving load with unchanged direction
