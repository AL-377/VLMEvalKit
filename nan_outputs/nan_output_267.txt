Okay, let's try to figure out which modification will increase the rate of the reaction the most. The options are A, B, C, D. Let me go through each one step by step.

First, the reaction in question is the dissolution of CaCO3(s) in HCl(aq). The reaction is exothermic, so cooling the HCl would slow down the reaction because the reaction is exothermic. So option B is cooling the HCl to a lower temperature. That would decrease the rate because the reaction is exothermic. So B is probably not the answer.

Option A is replacing HCl with CH3COOH. Both are acids, but HCl is a strong acid, while CH3COOH is a weak acid. Since the reaction is with HCl, which is a strong acid, replacing it with a weaker acid might slow down the reaction because the H+ ions from the acid are the ones reacting with CaCO3. A weaker acid would provide fewer H+ ions, so the reaction rate would be slower. So A would decrease the rate, not increase it. So A is not the answer.

Option C is reducing the volume of the reaction vessel. Wait, the volume of the reaction vessel is fixed because it's a sealed, rigid vessel. So changing the volume would be impossible here. The pressure is measured, but the volume is fixed. So if the volume is fixed, reducing the volume isn't possible. So C is not a valid option here. Hmm, maybe I need to check again. The question says "modifications," so maybe changing the volume isn't a modification. Maybe the volume is fixed, so C is not a valid option. So C is out.

Option D is using eggshells that are more finely powdered. Finely powdered eggshells would have a larger surface area, which would increase the reaction rate. Because when a solid is finely divided, it has more surface area exposed to the HCl, leading to a faster reaction. So D would increase the rate.

So the answer should be D. Let me just make sure. The other options: A is replacing HCl with a weaker acid, which would slow down the reaction. B is cooling the HCl, which would slow down the reaction because it's exothermic. C is changing the volume, but the vessel is rigid, so volume can't be changed. D is increasing surface area, which increases the rate. So yes, D is the correct answer.

The reaction rate of dissolving CaCO₃(s) in HCl(aq) is influenced by the modification that increases the surface area of the reactant. Finely powdered eggshells (D) expose more CaCO₃ surface area, enhancing the reaction rate. Options A (weaker acid) and B (lower temperature) decrease the rate due to reduced H⁺ ion concentration and exothermic cooling, respectively. Option C (reducing volume) is not feasible in a rigid vessel. 

**Answer:** D. Using eggshells that are more finely powdered than those used in the original experiment.
