Okay, let's try to figure out this question. The question is asking what "society" refers to, and there are four options provided. Let me go through each option one by one and see which one makes the most sense.

First, let's look at option A: "Refers to people who interact in a defined territory and share a culture." Hmm, that seems a bit too simplistic. While culture is part of society, society is more than just people sharing a culture. It also involves the structures, institutions, and interactions within that territory. So maybe A is not the best answer.

Option B says, "Is the values, beliefs, behavior, and material objects that, together, form a people's way of life." This sounds more comprehensive. Society encompasses not just the people but also the shared values, beliefs, behaviors, and material things that make up a culture. So this seems like a good candidate. But let me check the other options to be sure.

Option C: "Social cohesion (unity) results from the various parts of society functioning as an integrated whole." Wait, this is talking about the result of society rather than defining what society is. It's more about the outcome of society rather than the definition itself. So maybe C is not the correct answer.

Option D: "Culturally defined standards by which people assess desirability, goodness, and beauty and that serve as broad guidelines for social living." This seems to be about norms and values, which are part of society. But again, it's more about the standards rather than the definition of society itself. So D might be a part of society but not the definition.

So going back, option B seems to be the most accurate. Society is indeed the values, beliefs, behavior, and material objects that form a people's way of life. The other options either describe aspects of society or the result of society rather than the definition itself. Therefore, the correct answer should be B.

The question asks for the definition of "society." Among the options:

- **A** focuses narrowly on territory and culture, missing the broader societal structures and interactions.  
- **B** accurately captures society as the collective values, beliefs, behaviors, and material objects that constitute a culture and way of life.  
- **C** describes the outcome (social cohesion) rather than the definition.  
- **D** refers to cultural standards (norms) but does not fully encapsulate the entirety of societal elements.  

**Answer: B**  
**Explanation:** Society is the values, beliefs, behavior, and material objects that form a peopleâ€™s way of life.
