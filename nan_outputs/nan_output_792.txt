Okay, so I need to figure out which diagram illustrates the construction of a breadth-first spanning tree. The options are A and B. Let me start by recalling what a breadth-first spanning tree is. 

From what I remember, a breadth-first search (BFS) explores all the vertices of a graph level by level, starting from a root node. So, in the spanning tree, the algorithm should first select a root node and then explore all its neighbors at the same level (distance 1), then move to the next level (distance 2), and so on. The spanning tree constructed this way should have edges that connect nodes at the same level, forming a tree structure without cycles.

Looking at the diagrams:

In diagram A, the first step starts with a white node. Then, in step 2, the red node is connected. Step 3 connects a black node. The output is a tree where each node is connected to the next level. That seems like a level-by-level expansion, which is characteristic of BFS.

In diagram B, the first step starts with a white node. Step 2 connects a red node, but then step 3 connects a black node, which might not be at the same level. Then step 4 connects a red node again, and step 5 connects a black node. The output is a tree where some nodes are connected to multiple levels, which might not be the case in BFS. BFS typically explores all nodes at the same level before moving to the next, so connections between different levels might not be present in the spanning tree.

Wait, but in BFS, once you've processed all nodes at a certain level, you proceed to the next. So the spanning tree should have edges only between nodes at the same level. So in diagram A, each step adds a node of the next color, maintaining the level structure. In diagram B, the connections between different colors might indicate that nodes from different levels are connected, which would not be part of a BFS spanning tree.

Therefore, diagram A seems to follow the BFS level-by-level expansion, resulting in a breadth-first spanning tree. Diagram B's connections between different colors might indicate a different traversal order, perhaps depth-first or something else, which isn't BFS.

So the answer should be A.

The construction of a breadth-first spanning tree (BFS) proceeds by expanding nodes level by level, starting from a root node. Diagram A illustrates this process: each step connects nodes of the next color (white → red → black), ensuring all nodes at the same level are connected before moving to the next. Diagram B, however, connects nodes across different levels (e.g., white to black in step 2), which contradicts BFS's level-order traversal. Thus, **A** correctly depicts BFS.

**Answer:** A
