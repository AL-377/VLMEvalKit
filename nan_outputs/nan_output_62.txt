Okay, let's try to figure out why the Gliricidia sepium tree has sickly yellowed leaves on the left and normal growth on the right. Both are part of the same tree, so the issue must be localized. The symptoms aren't spread evenly across the crown, and some branches are dying. 

First, I need to recall what Gliricidia sepium is. It's a leguminous tree used in agroforestry, right? It's known for its rapid growth and nitrogen-fixing abilities. Now, the question is about the yellowing leaves and dying branches. 

Looking at the image, the left side has yellowed leaves, while the right has normal green leaves. The yellowing could be due to nutrient deficiency, but since it's a legume, maybe it's getting enough nitrogen. Alternatively, it could be a disease. The options given are virus, herbicide, fungus, phytoplasma, or unsure. 

Herbicide damage might cause leaf discoloration and stunted growth, but the description here is more about yellowing and some branches dying. If it's herbicide, the damage should be more uniform, maybe affecting the entire tree. But here, it's localized. 

Fungus disease could cause leaf spots or blight, but again, the symptoms aren't spread evenly. Maybe a fungal infection that's localized? But the options don't include that. 

Virus infection often causes mottling, yellowing, or necrosis. If it's a virus, the symptoms might be more systemic, but sometimes localized. However, viruses can cause localized symptoms if the tree is stressed. 

Phytoplasma is a bacterium-like organism that causes diseases like citrus variegated chlorosis. Symptoms include yellowing, distortion, and dieback. That sounds a lot like what's happening here. The tree has yellowed leaves, some branches dying. Phytoplasma can cause localized symptoms if the tree is stressed or has a weak point. 

Don't know, not sure, but the question is asking for the correct answer. The options are A to E. 

Wait, the image shows a detached branch. Maybe the branch was cut off, and the symptoms are on the cut end. If the tree is infected with phytoplasma, the disease can cause dieback and yellowing. The localized symptoms could be due to the cut surface, which is a weak point. 

Alternatively, herbicide damage might be possible if the tree was sprayed with a herbicide that affects the leaves but not the entire tree. But the question says the symptoms are not evenly spread across the crown. If it's herbicide, maybe it's affecting the leaves but not the rest of the tree. However, herbicide damage usually affects the entire plant, not just localized areas. 

Virus infection could be localized if the tree is stressed. But viruses typically cause systemic symptoms. However, if the tree is stressed due to some other factor, maybe the virus is localized. 

Phytoplasma is a possibility. The symptoms match. Dieback, yellowing, localized. So the answer is D. Phytoplasma. 

But wait, the options are A to E. Let me check again. The options are:

A. Virus infection

B. Herbicide damage

C. Fungus disease

D. Phytoplasma

E. Don't know, not sure

Given the symptoms, phytoplasma seems the most likely. So I think the correct answer is D.

The detached branch of Gliricidia sepium exhibits localized yellowing and dieback, with symptoms not evenly distributed across the crown. Phytoplasma diseases, such as citrus variegated chlorosis, are known to cause similar symptoms, including leaf discoloration, distortion, and dieback. The localized nature of the symptoms and the presence of dieback align with phytoplasma infection. Herbicide damage typically affects the entire plant uniformly, and virus infections usually cause systemic symptoms. Fungal diseases usually result in more uniform leaf spots or blight. 

**Answer:** D. Phytoplasma
