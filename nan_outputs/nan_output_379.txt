Okay, so I need to figure out which artist created this painting. The options are Wifredo Lam, Frida Kahlo, Diego Rivera, and Jacob Lawrence. Let me start by recalling what I know about each of these artists and their work.

First, Wifredo Lam was a Cuban artist known for his Cubist-influenced works that often incorporated African and Caribbean elements. He was part of the Surrealist movement and his paintings often featured abstracted human figures. But I'm not sure if this particular style matches the image here.

Frida Kahlo was a Mexican artist famous for her self-portraits and works that depicted her own experiences, often with a mix of realism and symbolic elements. Her works are known for their vibrant colors and detailed, personal narratives. The painting in question here is more abstract and doesn't seem to have the same level of detail or personal storytelling that Kahlo is known for.

Diego Rivera was another Mexican artist, famous for his large-scale murals. He often depicted social and political issues, using bold colors and figures. His work is more about public spaces and large-scale compositions, which might not align with the smaller, more abstract figures in this image.

Jacob Lawrence was an African American artist known for his series of paintings that depicted significant events in African American history, such as the migration from the South to the North. His works are characterized by their use of bold lines and simplified figures, often in a grid-like structure. The painting shown here has a similar style—simplified figures, bold lines, and a grid-like composition. The figures are arranged in a way that might represent different stages or aspects of a process, which is typical of Lawrence's work.

Looking at the image again, the figures are arranged in a vertical line, each in a different pose, connected by a central line. This structure is reminiscent of Lawrence's "The Migration Series," where each panel tells a part of the story of African Americans moving to the North. The use of a single line to connect the figures might symbolize the journey or the path taken. Additionally, the color palette and the style of the figures—simplified and almost geometric—align with Lawrence's style.

So, considering all these points, the most likely answer is Jacob Lawrence. The vertical arrangement, simplified figures, and the central connecting line are hallmarks of his Migration Series. Frida Kahlo's works are more personal and detailed, Diego Rivera's are more about murals and social issues, and Wifredo Lam's style is more abstract and Cubist. Therefore, the correct answer should be D. Jacob Lawrence.

The painting depicted in the image is characterized by its vertical arrangement of simplified figures connected by a central line, a style reminiscent of Jacob Lawrence's "The Migration Series." Lawrence's works often tell a narrative through bold lines and grid-like compositions, reflecting the journey of African Americans during the Great Migration. The abstract figures and symbolic elements align with Lawrence's artistic approach, distinguishing it from the more personal or mural-focused styles of the other options. 

**Answer:** D. Jacob Lawrence
