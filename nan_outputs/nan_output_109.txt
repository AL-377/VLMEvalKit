Okay, so I need to figure out who created this painting. The options are Michelangelo, Titian, Lucas van Leyden, or Leonardo da Vinci. Let me start by recalling what I know about each of these artists and their works.

First, Michelangelo was a Renaissance master known for his sculptures like the David and the Sistine Chapel ceiling. His style is more about anatomy and grandeur, so this painting might not be his. The painting here has a lot of detail in the clothing and the expressions, which might be more in line with Northern Renaissance artists.

Titian was a Venetian painter famous for his use of color and light. His works often have a luminous quality, which I don't see here. The scene in the painting seems more grounded and realistic, maybe with earthy tones, which isn't Titian's typical style.

Lucas van Leyden was a Dutch artist, part of the Northern Renaissance. He was known for his engravings and paintings that often depicted everyday life. The painting here shows a group of people playing cards, which is a common subject in Northern art. The clothing styles also seem to fit the 16th century, which aligns with van Leyden's time period. His work often had a lot of detail in the figures and the setting, which I can see here.

Leonardo da Vinci was another Italian Renaissance artist, famous for his anatomical studies and the Mona Lisa. His style is more about sfumato and the human form, which might not match the scene here. The figures in this painting don't have the same level of anatomical detail as Leonardo's works.

So, considering the options, Lucas van Leyden seems the most likely. The Northern Renaissance style, the detailed clothing, and the subject matter of everyday life all point to him. Let me double-check if there's a specific work by van Leyden that resembles this. The painting I'm looking at is "The Card Players," which is indeed a famous work by Lucas van Leyden. Yes, that's right. So the answer should be C.

The painting in question is "The Card Players," which is a well-known work by **Lucas van Leyden**. This Northern Renaissance masterpiece, created in the 16th century, is characterized by its detailed depiction of everyday life, realistic clothing, and intricate composition. 

**Answer:** C. LUCAS VAN LEYDEN
