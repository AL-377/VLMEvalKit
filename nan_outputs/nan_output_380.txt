Okay, let's see. The question is asking who sought out Eileen Gray and became an important patron for her work at the Salon des Artistes Décorateurs. The options are A. Le destin screen, B. Jacques Doucet, C. Salon des Artistes Décorateurs, D. Eileen Gray.

First, I need to recall who Eileen Gray was. She was a British-Irish artist and designer, right? She was known for her furniture and interior designs. The image provided is of a screen, which is one of her notable works. The screen is called "Le Destin" which translates to "The Destiny" in French. So that's option A. But the question isn't about the screen itself, but rather who sought her out and became a patron for her work at the Salon.

The Salon des Artistes Décorateurs was a French art and design exhibition. So the salon itself is option C. But the question is about who became a patron. Patrons are typically individuals who support artists financially or through patronage. So the answer is likely someone who supported her at the salon. 

Eileen Gray herself is an option D, but the question is asking who sought her out, not herself. So D is probably not the answer. Option A is the name of the screen, which is a specific work, but again, the question is about the person who supported her. 

Jacques Doucet was a French couturier and art collector. He was known for his patronage of artists and designers. He was a patron of the arts and often supported artists at exhibitions. So it's possible that he sought out Eileen Gray's work and supported her at the Salon. 

Therefore, the correct answer should be B. Jacques Doucet.
