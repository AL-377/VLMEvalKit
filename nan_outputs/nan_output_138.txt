Okay, so I need to figure out which painter created this portrait of a man in a red robe. The options are Picasso, Velazquez, Rembrandt, or El Greco. Let me start by recalling what I know about each of these artists and their styles.

First, Pablo Picasso is known for his cubist works, like "Les Demoiselles d'Avignon" and "Guernica." His portraits are often abstract or have fragmented styles. Since this painting seems more traditional, with realistic features and clothing, Picasso is probably not the right answer here.

Next, Diego Velazquez was a Spanish Baroque painter famous for his portraits and works like "Las Meninas." His style is characterized by rich colors, detailed brushwork, and a focus on capturing the sitter's personality. The man in the painting here has a serious expression, and the use of red and white in the clothing is reminiscent of Velazquez's portraits. The background also seems to have a deep red curtain, which is typical of his settings. Maybe this is a Velazquez piece?

Then there's Rembrandt, another Dutch Baroque painter. He's known for his use of chiaroscuro (strong contrasts between light and dark), dramatic lighting, and detailed, expressive portraits. The man in this painting doesn't seem to have the deep shadows or intense lighting that Rembrandt is famous for. His clothing is more uniform in color, and the overall composition is simpler. So Rembrandt might not be the correct choice here.

El Greco was a Greek painter who lived in Spain during the Renaissance and Baroque periods. His portraits are known for elongated figures, intense colors, and a somewhat otherworldly style. The man in this painting has a long nose and a somewhat elongated face, which might be characteristic of El Greco's style. However, the clothing here is more traditional, and the background is simpler. El Greco's portraits often have more dramatic poses and more stylized features, so maybe this isn't his work.

Wait, but let me think again. The man is wearing a red and white robe, which is similar to what popes or high-ranking church officials might wear. The setting is a throne-like chair with a red curtain, which is typical of portraits of religious figures. Velazquez was known for painting portraits of Spanish royalty and nobility, so this could fit. The style of the painting—realistic features, detailed clothing, and the use of red and gold—seems consistent with Velazquez's work. His portraits often have a sense of authority and dignity, which matches the man's posture and expression here.

I'm leaning towards B. Diego Velazquez. Let me check if there's any other clues. The painting's style doesn't seem to align with Rembrandt or El Greco. Picasso's works are too abstract. So yes, I think the answer is B.

The painting depicts a figure in a red and white robe seated on an ornate chair, set against a deep red curtain. The style is characterized by realistic details, rich colors, and a dignified composition, which are hallmarks of **Diego Velázquez**'s Baroque portraits. His works often featured religious and noble subjects with a focus on capturing personality and authority, consistent with the depicted figure's regal attire and composed demeanor. 

**Answer:** B. Diego Velazquez
