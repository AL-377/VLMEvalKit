Okay, let's see. The question is about a practice where students take on the role of TV or newspaper reporters and interview characters from a book to retell an event from different perspectives. The options are A. News Program, B. Readers Theatre, C. Hot Seat, D. News.

First, I need to understand each term. A News Program is a typical TV show that reports current events. Readers Theatre is when actors read a script aloud, often with dramatic effects. Hot Seat might be a game or activity where someone sits in a chair and others ask questions. News is just the content itself, not an activity.

The key here is that students are acting as reporters interviewing characters from a book. So they're reenacting a news report. The practice involves taking on the roles of reporters and interviewing characters, which sounds like a role-playing activity. Readers Theatre is about reading aloud, not necessarily interviewing. Hot Seat is more about answering questions, but not necessarily in a news context. News Program is the actual broadcast, not the activity.

So the correct term here is Hot Seat. Because in Hot Seat, you sit in a chair and answer questions, which matches the scenario where students are interviewing characters as reporters. The other options don't fit as well. News Program is the actual program, not the activity. Readers Theatre is about reading scripts. So C. Hot Seat seems right.

The practice described involves students acting as reporters interviewing book characters, a role-playing activity. **Hot Seat** (C) fits, as it involves taking turns answering questions in a simulated setting. 

**Answer:** C. Hot Seat
