Okay, let's see. The question is about social control and what it's used to maintain. The options are A. Formal sanctions, B. Social order, C. Cultural deviance, D. Sanction labelling.

First, I need to recall what social control is. From the image provided, social control is defined as rules and restrictions that shape, supervise, and regulate behaviors. The types mentioned are informal and formal. Informal includes things like shaming and praising, which are interpersonal strategies. Formal includes laws, curfews, stigmatization, dress codes, and censorship.

Now, the question is asking what social control maintains. The options are about formal sanctions, social order, cultural deviance, and sanction labelling.

Let me think. Social control is about maintaining order. Formal sanctions are part of formal social control, which are laws and regulations enforced by authorities. But the question is about what social control itself maintains. So maybe the answer is B. Social order. Because social control is the mechanism that enforces rules and regulations to maintain order. Formal sanctions are a part of that, but the broader concept is social order.

Cultural deviance refers to deviant behavior within a culture, which might be regulated by social control, but the question is about what social control maintains. D. Sanction labelling is about how deviant behavior is labeled and punished, which is part of formal social control but not the main purpose.

So, the answer should be B. Social order.

The concept of social control refers to the rules and restrictions that regulate individual and societal behaviors. While formal sanctions (laws, regulations) are part of formal social control (Option A), the primary purpose of social control is to maintain **social order** (Option B). Cultural deviance (Option C) and sanction labeling (Option D) are specific mechanisms within social control but do not encapsulate its overarching function. 

**Answer:** B. Social order
