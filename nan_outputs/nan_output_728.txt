Okay, let's see. The question is asking what percentage of the survey answered 'not sure'. The options are A through D, with numbers 0.04, 0.05, 0.06, and 0.07. 

First, I need to figure out how to calculate the percentage of people who answered 'not sure'. The table provided has relative frequencies for different salary ranges. But wait, the question is about 'not sure', which isn't listed in the table. Hmm. Maybe I need to check if there's a missing category or if the 'not sure' answers are included in the relative frequencies given.

Looking at the table, the categories are:

- <20,000
- 20,000–25,000
- 25,000–30,000
- 30,000–40,000
- 40,000–50,000
- 50,000–75,000
- 75,000–99,999
- 100,000+

Each of these has a relative frequency. The total relative frequency should add up to 1, right? Let me check that.

Adding all the relative frequencies:

0.02 + 0.09 + 0.19 + 0.26 + 0.18 + 0.17 + 0.02 + 0.01

Let me compute that step by step:

0.02 + 0.09 = 0.11

0.11 + 0.19 = 0.30

0.30 + 0.26 = 0.56

0.56 + 0.18 = 0.74

0.74 + 0.17 = 0.91

0.91 + 0.02 = 0.93

0.93 + 0.01 = 0.94

So the total relative frequency is 0.94. That means 94% of the respondents answered one of the salary ranges, and the remaining 6% must be 'not sure'. Wait, but the options given are 0.04, 0.05, 0.06, 0.07. So 0.94 is 94%, so the percentage of 'not sure' would be 100% - 94% = 6%. So 6% is 0.06, which is option C.

But let me double-check. The question says "include left endpoint, but not the right endpoint". The categories are defined with left endpoints included and right endpoints excluded. So the intervals are open at the upper end. For example, the first category is <20,000, which includes salaries less than 20,000. The last category is 100,000+, which includes salaries greater than 100,000. So all the categories are exclusive of the upper limit. Therefore, the total relative frequency is indeed 0.94, so 6% are left out, which is 'not sure'. Therefore, the answer should be C. 0.06.

Wait, but let me check the options again. The options are A. 0.04, B. 0.05, C. 0.06, D. 0.07. So 0.06 is option C. That seems correct. So the answer is C.

The total relative frequency of all salary ranges is calculated by summing the given values:  
0.02 + 0.09 + 0.19 + 0.26 + 0.18 + 0.17 + 0.02 + 0.01 = **0.94**.  

This means 94% of respondents answered a salary range, leaving **6% unaccounted**. Since the question asks for "not sure," this 6% corresponds to the percentage of respondents who did not specify.  

**Answer:** C. 0.06
