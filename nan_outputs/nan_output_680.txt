Okay, let's see. The question is about identifying which option is not considered a benefit to stakeholders by critics of stakeholder theory. The options are A. vague, B. extra, C. elusive, D. multidimensional. Hmm.

First, I need to recall what stakeholder theory is. Stakeholder theory suggests that organizations should consider the interests of all stakeholders, not just shareholders. Critics of this theory might argue that it's not beneficial for stakeholders in certain ways. The options given are adjectives describing something that might be a downside or not a benefit.

Let me break down each option:

A. Vague: If something is vague, it's unclear or not specific. Critics might argue that stakeholder theory is too vague, making it hard to implement or measure. So maybe this is a criticism.

B. Extra: Extra means additional or unnecessary. If stakeholders are considered beyond just shareholders, that might be seen as adding unnecessary complexity or burden. So this could be a criticism.

C. Elusive: Elusive means hard to find or achieve. If stakeholders are hard to identify or engage, that could be a problem. So this might be a criticism.

D. Multidimensional: Multidimensional means having many dimensions or aspects. This seems like a positive attribute. If stakeholders are considered in multiple dimensions (like economic, social, environmental), that could be a benefit. So D might not be a criticism.

So the question is asking which option is not considered a benefit to stakeholders. So the answer would be the one that's not a criticism. So D. Multidimensional is the benefit, while the others are criticisms. Therefore, the correct answer is D.

The question asks which option is not considered a benefit to stakeholders by critics of stakeholder theory. Stakeholder theory emphasizes considering all stakeholders, but critics argue that this approach has drawbacks. 

- **A. Vague** and **C. Elusive** describe challenges in implementing stakeholder theory, as it lacks clarity and may be hard to identify stakeholders.  
- **B. Extra** implies unnecessary complexity, suggesting stakeholders beyond shareholders add burden.  
- **D. Multidimensional** refers to considering stakeholders across multiple dimensions (e.g., economic, social, environmental), which is a **benefit**, not a criticism.  

Thus, **D. Multidimensional** is the benefit, not a criticism.  

**Answer:** D. multidimensional
