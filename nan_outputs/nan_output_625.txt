Okay, let's try to figure out this question. The map shows migrations and expulsions of Jews. The options are about whether Muslim, Catholic, or other regions were more likely to expel or accept Jews. 

First, I need to recall historical events related to Jewish expulsions. The map has arrows pointing from regions where Jews were expelled to others where they migrated. The years mentioned are 1492, 1497, and 1650. 

Looking at the map, the expulsions are marked with solid arrows. Let's see which regions expelled Jews. Spain and Portugal are shown with expulsions in 1492 and 1497. Then there's France, England, and Germany. The map also shows that Jews migrated to Ottoman Empire, Russia, and other areas. 

Now, the options:

A. Muslim regions were more likely to expel. The Ottoman Empire is a Muslim region, and the map shows Jews migrating there. So maybe they didn't expel? But Spain and Portugal were Catholic, and they expelled. So maybe A is not correct.

B. Most expulsions originated in Protestant regions. But the map doesn't show Protestant regions. The map is mainly European, but the Ottoman Empire is Muslim. So B might not be accurate.

C. Catholic regions were more likely to expel. Spain and Portugal were Catholic, and they expelled. France and England were also Catholic, but France didn't expel in the 15th century. Germany had expulsions in 1497-1650. So maybe C is correct because Spain and Portugal were Catholic and expelled, while other regions like the Ottoman Empire (Muslim) didn't expel as much. 

D. Jews migrated voluntarily to regions with economic prosperity. The map shows migrations from areas with expulsions to others. But economic prosperity isn't directly indicated. The map just shows where they went, not necessarily economic factors. So D might not be accurate.

So the best answer is C. Catholic regions were more likely to expel. Even though France didn't expel in the 15th century, the map shows that Spain and Portugal (Catholic) expelled, and Germany (Catholic) had expulsions later. The Ottoman Empire (Muslim) didn't expel much. So the majority of expulsions were in Catholic regions, making C the correct answer.

The map illustrates Jewish expulsions and migrations across Europe and the Ottoman Empire. Key points:

- **Spain and Portugal (Catholic)** expelled Jews in 1492 and 1497, respectively. 
- **France and England (Catholic)** also expelled Jews in the 15th century, though the map shows later migrations to the Ottoman Empire.
- **Germany (Catholic)** experienced expulsions in 1497â€“1650.
- **Ottoman Empire (Muslim)** did not expel Jews significantly, as they migrated there.

Expulsions were most frequent in **Catholic regions** (Spain, Portugal, France, England, Germany), while the Ottoman Empire (Muslim) remained relatively tolerant. Thus, **Catholic regions were more likely to expel**, making **C** the correct answer. 

**Answer:** C
