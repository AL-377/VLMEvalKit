Okay, so I need to figure out if the name of this artwork is "This is not a Pipe" by René Magritte. Let me start by recalling what I know about this famous painting. I remember that it's a surrealist piece, and the title is in French. The image shows a pipe, but the text below it says "Ceci n'est pas une pipe," which translates to "This is not a pipe" in English. Magritte is definitely the artist known for this piece. 

Wait, but let me make sure I'm not confusing it with another artwork. There's a similar painting called "The Treachery of Images" which is another version of this concept. But the one in question here is the original. The style and the pipe's shape look familiar. The pipe is depicted in a way that it's almost like a real pipe, but the text directly contradicts that. 

Another thing to consider is the artist's name. Magritte was a Belgian surrealist painter, and this painting is one of his most famous works. The text in the image is a play on words, using the word "pipe" to create a paradox. The phrase "Ceci n'est pas une pipe" is a classic example of a linguistic paradox, similar to the "This is not a pipe" joke. 

I should also check if there's any possibility of a different title or artist. But I can't think of another artist associated with this particular piece. The painting is widely recognized as Magritte's "The Treachery of Images," which is the English translation of the French title. So the answer should be True, A. True.

The artwork in question is indeed "The Treachery of Images" by René Magritte. The French text "Ceci n'est pas une pipe" translates to "This is not a pipe," a paradoxical statement that challenges the relationship between words and objects. Magritte's work is renowned for such linguistic and visual puzzles, making this identification correct. 

**Answer:** A. True
