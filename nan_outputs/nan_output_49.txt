Okay, so I need to figure out what these yellow spheres connected to the potato roots are. Let me start by looking at the image. The roots are visible, and there are these small yellow structures attached to them. They look like little balls or spheres, not like the typical roots which are more fibrous or branching. 

First, I remember that potatoes can have various types of growths on their roots. Sclerotia are structures that some fungi form, right? They're like hardened masses that can be yellow or brown. Cysts are usually more like small, hard, seed-like structures, maybe from nematodes or other parasites. Eggs would be more like small, oval shapes, maybe from insects or mites. Galls are abnormal growths caused by insects or mites, which might be different in appearance.

Looking at the image, the yellow spheres are round and clustered. Sclerotia often have a more compact, hard appearance, and sometimes they're associated with diseases like potato blight. But I'm not sure if that's the case here. Cysts might be smaller and more numerous, but again, the image shows larger yellow spheres. Eggs are usually much smaller and might be in clusters, but I don't see that here. Galls could be more irregular in shape, but these are spherical.

Wait, another thought: some fungi form these structures as a way to survive unfavorable conditions. Sclerotia are the hardened parts of the fungus that can survive in soil for years. If these are sclerotia, then they might be part of a fungal infection. But I'm not certain. Alternatively, could they be eggs from a pest? For example, some insects lay eggs on roots, but eggs are usually smaller and more numerous. 

Alternatively, maybe it's a type of gall. Galls can be caused by various organisms, including fungi, bacteria, or insects. If it's a gall, the structure might be more irregular or have a different texture. But the image shows smooth, yellow spheres. 

Hmm. Let me think again. Sclerotia are typically brown or black, but maybe they can be yellow. I've seen images of potato blight where sclerotia are present. If that's the case, then A might be the answer. But I need to be careful. Cysts can also be yellow. Cysts are usually more like small, hard, seed-like structures. If these are cysts, then B. But I'm not sure. 

Alternatively, maybe it's a type of fungal infection that forms these yellow spheres. Without more information, it's hard to tell. But given the options, I think the most plausible answer is A. Sclerotia. Because they are structures that fungi form to survive, and they can be yellow. Cysts are more likely to be smaller and more numerous, but the image shows larger yellow spheres. Eggs are too small. Galls are more irregular. So I think A is the best answer here.

The yellow spheres attached to the potato roots are most likely **sclerotia**, which are hardened fungal structures formed by certain pathogens. These structures are typically yellow or brown and serve as survival mechanisms for fungi in soil. While cysts (B) and galls (D) can also form on roots, their appearance and context in the image align more closely with sclerotia. Eggs (C) are too small and irregular, and the smooth, clustered spheres in the image are inconsistent with galls. 

**Answer:** A. Sclerotia
