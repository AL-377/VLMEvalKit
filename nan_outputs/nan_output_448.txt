Okay, let's see. The question is about testing whether the coefficient for C3 is equal to the coefficient for C4. The null hypothesis here would be that the coefficients are the same, right? So, H0: β_C3 = β_C4. The alternative would be that they are different, H1: β_C3 ≠ β_C4.

Now, looking at the table, the coefficients for C3 and C4 are 0.0831 and 0.0929, respectively. To test if these are significantly different, we need to calculate the t-statistic for the difference between these two coefficients. The formula for the t-statistic when comparing two coefficients is:

t = (β_C3 - β_C4) / sqrt(Var(β_C3) + Var(β_C4))

But since we don't have the variances of the coefficients, we can use the standard errors provided. The standard errors for C3 and C4 are 0.0442 and 0.0568, respectively. So, the t-statistic would be:

t = (0.0831 - 0.0929) / sqrt(0.0442² + 0.0568²)

Let me compute that. First, the numerator: 0.0831 - 0.0929 = -0.0098.

Denominator: sqrt(0.0442² + 0.0568²). Let's calculate each term:

0.0442² = 0.00195364

0.0568² = 0.00322944

Adding them: 0.00195364 + 0.00322944 = 0.00518308

Square root of that: sqrt(0.00518308) ≈ 0.07198

So, the t-statistic is -0.0098 / 0.07198 ≈ -0.137

Now, the p-value for this t-statistic is given as 0.1019. Since the p-value (0.1019) is greater than the significance level of 0.05, we fail to reject the null hypothesis. Therefore, the correct answer should be option B: The null cannot be rejected at the 5% significance level.

Wait, but let me double-check. The p-value is 0.1019, which is indeed larger than 0.05. So, yes, we don't reject the null. So the answer is B. But let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in calculating the t-statistic.

Alternatively, maybe the question is referring to a different test? For example, maybe comparing the coefficients to zero? But no, the question specifically says "the Coefficient associated to a level C3 branch is equal to that of a C4 branch". So, comparing C3 and C4 directly.

Another way to check is to see if the p-value is less than 0.05. Since 0.1019 is greater than 0.05, we can't reject the null. So, answer B. The options are A: reject at 5%, B: can't reject, C: no info. So B is correct.

To test the null hypothesis that the coefficients for \( C3 \) and \( C4 \) are equal, we calculate the t-statistic for their difference:

\[
t = \frac{\beta_{C3} - \beta_{C4}}{\sqrt{\text{Var}(\beta_{C3}) + \text{Var}(\beta_{C4})}} = \frac{0.0831 - 0.0929}{\sqrt{0.0442^2 + 0.0568^2}} \approx \frac{-0.0098}{0.07198} \approx -0.137
\]

The corresponding p-value is 0.1019, which is greater than the 5% significance level. Since the p-value does not fall below the threshold, we **cannot reject the null hypothesis**. 

**Answer:** B. The null cannot be rejected at the 5% significance level.
