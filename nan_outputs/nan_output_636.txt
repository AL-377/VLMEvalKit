Okay, let's see. The question is about terms related to the theme of a book. The options are A. Theme, B. Explicit Themes, C. Biography Series, D. Secondary Themes. The image shows a person reading a book with a magnifying glass and question marks, which might symbolize analysis or deeper understanding. 

First, I need to recall what each term means. The main theme of a book is the central idea or message, right? So Theme (A) would be the primary idea. But the question is about a theme that's of lesser importance to the book but significant to specific readers. So maybe it's a secondary theme, which is a supporting idea that's not the main one but still important. 

Option D is Secondary Themes. That makes sense because secondary themes are those that aren't the main focus but add depth. Explicit Themes (B) are the ones clearly stated in the text, like the main idea. Biography Series (C) is about a series of books about a person's life, which isn't directly related to the theme question. 

So the answer should be D. Secondary Themes. The person in the image is analyzing the book, looking for deeper meanings, which aligns with considering secondary themes that might be significant to readers but not the main theme of the book itself.

The term that refers to a theme of lesser importance to the book but significant to specific readers is **D. Secondary Themes**. Secondary themes are supporting ideas that enrich the book but are not the central message. The image of analysis and questioning (with magnifying glass and question marks) aligns with exploring deeper, secondary meanings relevant to individual readers. 

**Answer:** D. Secondary Themes
