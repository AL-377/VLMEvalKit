Okay, let's see. The question is about calculating the maximum possible loss for a long strangle strategy at expiration. The options are A. $9.00, B. $5.00, and C. the maximum possible loss is unlimited. Hmm. 

First, I need to recall what a strangle is. A strangle is a combination of a call and a put option with the same expiration date but different strike prices. The investor buys both a call and a put. The goal is to profit when the underlying stock moves significantly in either direction. So, if the stock price goes above the call's strike price or below the put's strike price, the investor makes money. But if the stock stays between the two strike prices, the investor loses the premium paid for both options.

Now, the problem gives me the current stock price as $58. The call option has a strike price of $60 and is priced at $5, while the put option has a strike price of $55 and is priced at $4. Both options expire in 90 days. 

The question is asking for the maximum possible loss at expiration for a long strangle strategy. Let me think. For a strangle, the maximum loss occurs when the stock price at expiration is exactly between the two strike prices. Wait, no. Wait, actually, the maximum loss is when the stock price is exactly at the lower strike price for the put and the upper strike price for the call. Wait, no. Let me clarify.

In a strangle, the investor buys a call and a put. The maximum loss occurs when the stock price is between the two strike prices. Because if the stock is between the strike prices, the call is out of the money (since it's below the strike price) and the put is also out of the money (since it's above the strike price). So, both options would have zero value, and the investor loses the premium paid for both options. Therefore, the maximum loss is the sum of the premiums paid for both options.

But wait, the strike prices are $55 and $60. So, if the stock is between $55 and $60 at expiration, both options are worthless. Therefore, the investor loses the total premium paid, which is $5 (call) + $4 (put) = $9. So, the maximum possible loss is $9.00. That would be option A.

But let me double-check. Let's think of the possible scenarios:

1. If the stock price is above $60 at expiration: The call is in the money, the put is out of the money. The investor makes money on the call, loses on the put. The net is (60 - 58) - 4 = $2 - $4 = -$2. So, a loss of $2.

2. If the stock price is below $55 at expiration: The put is in the money, the call is out of the money. The investor makes money on the put, loses on the call. The net is (55 - 58) - 5 = -$3 - $5 = -$8. So, a loss of $8.

3. If the stock price is between $55 and $60: Both options are out of the money. The investor loses the entire premium paid for both options: $5 + $4 = $9. So, a loss of $9.

4. If the stock price is exactly $55: The put is at the strike price, so it's worth $0. The call is out of the money, worth $0. So, the investor loses $9.

5. If the stock price is exactly $60: The call is at the strike price, worth $0. The put is out of the money, worth $0. So, the investor loses $9.

Therefore, the maximum possible loss is $9.00. So, the answer should be A. $9.00.

But wait, the options given are A. $9.00, B. $5.00, C. the maximum possible loss is unlimited. So, the correct answer is A. Because even though the options have different strike prices, the maximum loss is capped at the sum of the premiums paid. There's no unlimited loss because once the stock is between the two strike prices, both options are worthless, and the loss is limited to the premiums. So, the maximum possible loss is $9.00, not unlimited. Therefore, option C is incorrect. So, the answer is A.

The maximum possible loss for a long strangle strategy occurs when the stock price at expiration is between the two strike prices. At this point, both the call and put options are out of the money, resulting in a loss equal to the total premium paid for both options. The premiums are $5 (call) and $4 (put), totaling $9.00. If the stock price is outside the range of the strike prices, the investor makes a profit. Thus, the maximum loss is **$9.00**.

**Answer:** A. $9.00
