Okay, let's see. The problem is about finding the new equilibrium price after adding more students to the college. The original demand and supply schedules are given, and then there's a new demand schedule for the additional 5,000 students. I need to combine the old demand with the new one and then find the equilibrium price where quantity demanded equals quantity supplied.

First, let me recall that equilibrium occurs where the quantity demanded equals the quantity supplied. So, I need to add the old demand and the new demand schedules together for each price point and see which price makes the total demanded equal to the total supplied.

Looking at the original demand schedule:

At $4, old demand is 10,000 tickets.
At $8, old demand is 8,000 tickets.
At $12, old demand is 6,000 tickets.
At $16, old demand is 4,000 tickets.
At $20, old demand is 2,000 tickets.

Then the new demand schedule for the additional 5,000 students:

At $4, new demand is 4,000 tickets.
At $8, new demand is 3,000 tickets.
At $12, new demand is 2,000 tickets.
At $16, new demand is 1,000 tickets.
At $20, new demand is 0 tickets.

So, to get the new demand schedule, I need to add the old demand and the new demand for each price. Let's do that step by step.

Starting with $4:
Old demand: 10,000
New demand: 4,000
Total demand: 10,000 + 4,000 = 14,000 tickets

At $8:
Old: 8,000
New: 3,000
Total: 11,000

At $12:
Old: 6,000
New: 2,000
Total: 8,000

At $16:
Old: 4,000
New: 1,000
Total: 5,000

At $20:
Old: 2,000
New: 0
Total: 2,000

Now, let's look at the original supply schedule. The supply is always 8,000 tickets at every price. So, regardless of the price, the quantity supplied is 8,000.

So, the new equilibrium price is where the total demand equals 8,000. Let's check each price:

At $4: Total demand is 14,000. That's way higher than supply (8,000). So, not equilibrium.

At $8: Total demand is 11,000. Still higher than supply.

At $12: Total demand is 8,000. That's exactly equal to supply. So, this is the equilibrium point.

At $16: Total demand is 5,000. Lower than supply.

At $20: Total demand is 2,000. Lower than supply.

Therefore, the equilibrium price should be $12. Let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't add incorrectly.

Old demand at $4: 10,000. New demand: 4,000. Total: 14,000. Correct.

At $8: 8,000 + 3,000 = 11,000. Correct.

At $12: 6,000 + 2,000 = 8,000. Correct.

At $16: 4,000 + 1,000 = 5,000. Correct.

At $20: 2,000 + 0 = 2,000. Correct.

Supply is always 8,000. So, the only price where total demand equals 8,000 is $12. Therefore, the answer should be C. 12.

To determine the new equilibrium price, we first combine the old demand schedule with the additional demand from the new students. 

**Old Demand Schedule:**
- $4: 10,000 tickets
- $8: 8,000 tickets
- $12: 6,000 tickets
- $16: 4,000 tickets
- $20: 2,000 tickets

**New Demand Schedule (additional 5,000 students):**
- $4: 4,000 tickets
- $8: 3,000 tickets
- $12: 2,000 tickets
- $16: 1,000 tickets
- $20: 0 tickets

**Total Demand Schedule:**
- $4: 10,000 + 4,000 = 14,000
- $8: 8,000 + 3,000 = 11,000
- $12: 6,000 + 2,000 = 8,000
- $16: 4,000 + 1,000 = 5,000
- $20: 2,000 + 0 = 2,000

**Supply Schedule:**
- All prices: 8,000 tickets

The equilibrium occurs where total demand equals supply. At **$12**, total demand is 8,000, matching the supply. Prices below $12 result in excess demand, and prices above $12 result in excess supply.

**Answer:** C. 12
