Okay, so I need to figure out whether the error bound would be larger or smaller if the sample size n were increased from 39 to 69, keeping the same x_bar, s_x, and level of confidence. Hmm, let's start by recalling what an error bound (EB) is in the context of confidence intervals. 

From what I remember, the error bound formula for a confidence interval for the population mean μ when the population standard deviation σ is unknown is:

EB = t*(s_x / sqrt(n))

Where:
- t is the critical value from the t-distribution corresponding to the desired confidence level and degrees of freedom (df = n - 1)
- s_x is the sample standard deviation
- n is the sample size

So, the error bound depends on three factors: the critical value t, the sample standard deviation s_x, and the sample size n. The question is asking how changing n from 39 to 69 would affect the error bound, assuming t and s_x remain the same.

Let me break it down. The critical value t depends on the confidence level and the degrees of freedom. Since the confidence level isn't changing, t should remain the same. The sample standard deviation s_x is also given as the same in both cases, right? The problem states "using the same x_bar, s_x, and level of confidence," so s_x is fixed. 

The only variable here is n. So, if n increases from 39 to 69, what happens to the error bound? Let's plug into the formula:

EB = t*(s_x / sqrt(n))

If n increases, the denominator sqrt(n) increases because the square root of a larger number is larger. Therefore, the entire expression (s_x / sqrt(n)) would decrease. Since t is positive, multiplying a smaller number by t would result in a smaller error bound. 

Wait, but let me make sure I'm not mixing up anything. The error bound is inversely proportional to the square root of n. So, as n increases, the denominator increases, making the whole fraction smaller. Therefore, the error bound should decrease. 

But let me think again. Suppose n was 39. Then sqrt(39) is approximately 6.245. If n becomes 69, sqrt(69) is approximately 8.306. So, the denominator increases by about 8.306 / 6.245 ≈ 1.333. Therefore, the fraction (s_x / sqrt(n)) would be multiplied by 1/1.333 ≈ 0.75. So, the error bound would be multiplied by 0.75, which is smaller. 

Therefore, increasing n should lead to a smaller error bound. So the answer should be B. Smaller.

But wait, let me check if there's any other factor I might have missed. The problem mentions "the same x_bar, s_x, and level of confidence." So x_bar is the sample mean, which is the sample mean. The error bound formula uses the sample standard deviation, not the population standard deviation. So s_x is given as the same. The critical value t is determined by the confidence level and degrees of freedom. Since the confidence level is the same, t remains the same. Therefore, the only variable changing is n, and since n increases, the error bound decreases. 

Another way to think about it: when you have a larger sample size, the sample mean is a better estimate of the population mean, so the confidence interval is narrower. Therefore, the error bound should be smaller. 

Yes, that makes sense. So the answer is B. Smaller.

The error bound (EB) for a confidence interval is given by:

\[
EB = t \cdot \left( \frac{s_x}{\sqrt{n}} \right)
\]

where \( t \) is the critical value from the t-distribution, \( s_x \) is the sample standard deviation, and \( n \) is the sample size. Since \( t \) and \( s_x \) remain unchanged, the primary factor affecting \( EB \) is \( n \). As \( n \) increases, \( \sqrt{n} \) increases, making the denominator larger. This reduces the value of \( \frac{s_x}{\sqrt{n}} \), thereby decreasing the error bound. 

Thus, increasing \( n \) from 39 to 69 would result in a smaller error bound. 

**Answer:** B. Smaller.
