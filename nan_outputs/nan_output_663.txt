Okay, let's see. The question is asking which term refers to the part that follows the exposition where the conflict is introduced. The options are A. falling action, B. climax, C. exposition, D. rising action.

First, I need to recall what each of these terms means in the context of a narrative structure. Exposition is where the setting, characters, and conflict are introduced. The rising action is the part that builds up the conflict, leading up to the climax. The climax is the peak of the conflict, the turning point. Falling action is when things start to wrap up after the climax.

So the question is about the part that comes after the exposition where the conflict is introduced. That would be the rising action, because after introducing the conflict, you start developing it through rising action. The rising action is the buildup to the climax. Exposition is the beginning, falling action is after the climax, and the climax is the peak. So the answer should be D. rising action.

The term that follows the exposition (where the conflict is introduced) is the **rising action**, which builds the tension leading up to the climax. 

**Answer:** D. rising action
