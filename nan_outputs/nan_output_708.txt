Okay, let's see. The question is asking about the shape of this distribution. The options are skewed left, skewed right, or symmetric. I need to figure out which one it is based on the histogram provided.

First, I should recall what each type of distribution looks like. A skewed left distribution, or left-skewed, has a longer tail on the left side. That means the majority of the data is on the right, and the tail is on the left. On the other hand, a skewed right distribution has a longer tail on the right, so the majority is on the left, and the tail is on the right. A symmetric distribution is one where the left and right sides mirror each other, so there's no tail on either side.

Looking at the histogram, the bars are arranged from left to right. The first bar is at 3, then 4, then 5, 6, and 7. The heights of the bars are as follows: the first bar (3) is 1, the next (4) is 1, then (5) is 2, (6) is 4, and (7) is 7. So, the frequencies increase as we move from left to right. 

Starting from the left, the first two bars (3 and 4) are the same height, then the next one (5) is taller, followed by (6) which is even taller, and finally (7) which is the tallest. So, the distribution is increasing from left to right. That means the majority of the data is on the right side, and the tail is on the left. Wait, but in a skewed right distribution, the tail is on the right. So if the tail is on the left, that would be a skewed left distribution. But here, the tail is on the left, so the distribution is skewed left.

But let me double-check. If the tail is on the left, that means the data is more concentrated on the right. So the longer tail is on the left, which is characteristic of a left-skewed distribution. So the answer should be A. The distribution is skewed left.

Wait, but sometimes people get confused between left and right. Let me make sure. If the majority of the data is on the right, the tail is on the left, so it's left-skewed. If the majority is on the left, the tail is on the right, so right-skewed. So in this case, since the majority is on the right (from 6 and 7), the tail is on the left, so it's left-skewed. Therefore, the correct answer is A.

The histogram shows an increasing frequency from left to right, with the tallest bar at 7 and the shortest at 3. The majority of the data is concentrated on the right side (6 and 7), while the left side (3 and 4) has fewer observations. This indicates a **longer tail on the left**, which defines a **left-skewed distribution**. 

**Answer:** A. The distribution is skewed left.
