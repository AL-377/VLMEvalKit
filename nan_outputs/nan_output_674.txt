Okay, let's try to figure out this question. The image shows a head with a brain divided into two parts: one labeled "divergent" with "creativity" and "arts stereotype," and the other labeled "convergent" with "science stereotype." The text mentions that divergence precedes convergence, like unfolding like a fruiting tree, and some ideas converge into new products. Critics complain about many divergent ideas ending up nowhere. The options are A to D, and I need to pick the correct one.

First, let me understand the question. The key points are:
1. Divergence comes before convergence.
2. Divergent ideas lead to broad changes.
3. Some of these changes converge into innovative products.
4. Critics complain about many divergent ideas not leading anywhere.

Now, looking at the options:
A. No need to diverge – This seems too extreme. The figure shows divergence is necessary for creativity, so maybe not the answer.
B. Disagreement is wasteful and self-indulgent – Hmm. Disagreement is part of divergence. If critics complain about many ideas not working, maybe they think too much disagreement is bad. But the question is about what critics complain about, not about the process itself. So maybe not B.
C. Convergence proceeds too slowly – The text doesn't mention convergence being slow. It says some ideas converge into products, but maybe critics think convergence is too slow. Not sure if that's the main point.
D. The process of divergence-convergence is of little significance – This seems like a general criticism. Critics might think that the process isn't important because most divergent ideas don't lead anywhere. That makes sense. The figure shows divergence leading to a lot of branches (divergent), but only a few converging. Critics might dismiss the whole process as not worth doing because most ideas don't result in anything. So D could be the answer.

Wait, but the question is about what critics complain about. The options are about the process's significance. So if critics think the process is insignificant because most ideas don't lead anywhere, then D is correct. The other options are about the process itself, not the complaints. So yes, D seems right.

The process of divergence and convergence involves generating broad ideas (divergence) that later converge into innovative products. Critics complain about many divergent ideas failing to produce meaningful outcomes. The correct answer is:

**D. The process of divergence-convergence is of little significance.**  
Critics dismiss the process as unimportant because most divergent ideas do not lead to actionable results, despite the potential for some convergence.
