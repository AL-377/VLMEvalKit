Okay, so I need to figure out which artist this painting is by based on the style. The options are Paul Cézanne, Claude Monet, José María Velasco, and Vincent van Gogh. Let me start by recalling what I know about each of these artists and their styles.

First, Paul Cézanne is known for his post-impressionist work, often using bold brushstrokes and a more structured approach to form. His paintings often have a sense of geometric order, maybe like how he broke down objects into cubes and spheres. But I'm not sure if that's the case here. The image I see has a lot of swirling clouds and a cypress tree, which might not fit Cézanne's style as much.

Claude Monet is famous for his impressionist paintings, characterized by light and color, often capturing the same subject multiple times in different weather conditions. His works usually have a softer, more blended appearance, with less defined edges. The style here seems a bit more textured and maybe with more visible brushstrokes, which might not align with Monet's typical approach.

José María Velasco... Hmm, I'm not as familiar with his work. Maybe he's a Spanish artist? If so, his style might be different. But without more context, it's hard to say. Maybe his work is more realistic or traditional? Not sure, but I'll keep that in mind.

Vincent van Gogh is known for his post-impressionist style, with thick, impasto brushstrokes and vibrant colors. His works often have a strong emotional impact and are characterized by swirling, dynamic lines. The painting in question has a lot of movement in the clouds and the cypress tree, which seems to fit van Gogh's style. The texture of the brushstrokes also looks similar to his technique. The cypress tree is a common subject in van Gogh's works, especially in his later years when he was in Arles.

Let me compare the elements. The sky is filled with swirling clouds, which is a signature element in van Gogh's work. The cypress tree is a symbol of his time in Arles. The brushwork is thick and expressive, creating a sense of movement and emotion. Monet's works are more about light and atmosphere, with softer edges and less contrast. Cézanne's style is more about structure and form, with a more geometric approach. Velasco's style is less clear to me, but maybe more traditional.

So, putting it all together, the combination of the swirling sky, cypress tree, thick brushstrokes, and emotional expression points towards van Gogh. I think the answer is D.

The painting exhibits dynamic brushwork, swirling skies, and a cypress tree, characteristic of **Vincent van Gogh's post-impressionist style**. His works often feature expressive, textured strokes and symbolic elements like cypress trees. The emotional intensity and movement in the clouds align with van Gogh's artistic vision. 

**Answer:** D. Vincent van Gogh
