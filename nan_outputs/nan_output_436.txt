Okay, let's see. The question is asking for net exports for China based on the given table. Hmm, net exports... I remember that net exports are calculated by subtracting imports from exports. So, the formula is Net Exports = Exports - Imports. 

Looking at the table, under the "Exports" category, it says 50 billion. Under "Imports," it's 40 billion. So, if I subtract 40 from 50, that should give me the net exports. Let me check again. Exports are 50, Imports are 40. 50 minus 40 is 10. So, the net exports would be 10 billion. 

Looking at the options, A is 10, B is 5, C is 20. So, the correct answer should be A. 10. Wait, but let me make sure I didn't mix up any other categories. The table has other entries like government expenditure, taxes, depreciation, etc., but those aren't part of the net exports calculation. Only exports and imports are relevant here. Yeah, so I think that's right. Net exports are 10 billion, so option A.

To determine net exports for China, subtract imports from exports:  
**Net Exports = Exports - Imports**  
Given:  
- Exports = 50 billion  
- Imports = 40 billion  

**Calculation:**  
\( 50 - 40 = 10 \)  

**Answer:** A. 10
