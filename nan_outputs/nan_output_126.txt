Okay, so I need to figure out which twentieth-century sculptor was influenced by Mayan chacmool sculptures. The options are Louise Bourgeois, Henry Moore, Barbara Hepworth, and Constantin Brancusi. Let me start by recalling what I know about chacmool sculptures.

Chacmool is a specific type of sculpture from the Maya civilization. From what I remember, these sculptures depict figures lying on their backs with their hands resting on their chests. The name "chac" comes from the Maya word for rain god, and "mool" might relate to a deity or a specific god. So, these statues are typically associated with the Maya, particularly from the Classic period, around 250-900 CE.

Now, the question is about twentieth-century sculptors. Let me think about each option. 

First, Louise Bourgeois (option A). She was a French-American sculptor known for her abstract works, often involving human forms and emotions. Her sculptures often depicted women and had a lot of organic, flowing lines. I don't recall her works being directly influenced by Mayan art. Maybe her use of human figures, but not specifically the chacmool style.

Next, Henry Moore (option B). He was a British sculptor famous for his large-scale abstract sculptures, often made of stone or bronze. His works often featured organic shapes, like the human body or natural forms. While his style was abstract, I'm not sure if there's a direct connection to Mayan art. Maybe some influence from pre-Columbian art in general, but not specifically the chacmool.

Barbara Hepworth (option C). She was a British sculptor who worked with stone and wood, creating abstract forms. Her work was influenced by both prehistoric and pre-Columbian art. I think she was interested in the geometric abstraction of African and Maya art. Maybe she was influenced by the simplicity and geometric shapes in Mayan art, but not specifically the chacmool figures.

Constantin Brancusi (option D). He was a Romanian sculptor known for his minimalist, abstract sculptures. His most famous works include "The Kiss" and "Bird in Space." I remember that Brancusi's sculptures often featured simplified human and animal forms. The chacmool, with its reclining figure and hands on chest, seems to have a similar simplified, almost geometric quality. Brancusi's work in the 1920s and 1930s often drew inspiration from African and pre-Columbian art, which includes the Maya. So maybe he was influenced by the Mayan chacmool.

Wait, but how do I confirm this? Let me think about specific examples. Brancusi's "Sleeping Muse" (1910) is a reclining figure with hands on chest, similar to the chacmool. Also, his "The Three Dancers" (1923-1924) have a more dynamic pose, but the chacmool is more static. The chacmool's posture is quite iconic, with the figure lying on its back, hands on chest, and sometimes a bowl or vessel on its stomach. Brancusi's work in the 1920s and 1930s definitely incorporated elements from African and Maya art, so it's plausible that the chacmool influenced him.

On the other hand, Bourgeois, Moore, and Hepworth might have been influenced by other sources. For example, Bourgeois's work often has a more personal, emotional quality, while Moore's work is more about the human form in abstract terms. Hepworth's work is more geometric and less about specific figures. So, the most likely answer is D, Constantin Brancusi.

The Mayan chacmool sculptures, characterized by their reclining figures with hands on chests, influenced the work of **Constantin Brancusi** (option D). Brancusi's sculptures, particularly from the 1920s and 1930s, often incorporated simplified, geometric forms and dynamic postures, reflecting his interest in pre-Columbian art. His iconic works, such as "The Sleeping Muse" (1910) and "The Three Dancers" (1923–1924), align with the static yet symbolic nature of the chacmool. Other options—Louise Bourgeois, Henry Moore, and Barbara Hepworth—while influential in their own right—do not specifically trace their inspiration to the Mayan chacmool. 

**Answer:** D. Constantin Brancusi
