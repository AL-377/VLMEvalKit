Okay, let's try to figure out what process is being shown in this figure. The image has two main parts: a bacterial cell and a human cell. The bacterial cell has a plasmid, which is a small circular DNA molecule. The human cell is providing a gene for human growth hormone. The steps are numbered from 1 to 7, so I need to follow each step carefully.

Starting with step 1: The bacterial cell is shown with a plasmid. Then step 2 comes from the human cell, which is the gene for human growth hormone. Step 3 looks like the gene is being cut out or isolated from the human cell. Step 4 is the gene being inserted into the bacterial plasmid. Then step 5 shows the plasmid being reintroduced into the bacterial cell. Step 6 and 7 show the bacterial cell multiplying, and the plasmid is replicated along with the bacterial DNA. The final result is multiple bacterial cells each containing the human growth hormone gene.

Hmm, so this seems like genetic engineering or recombinant DNA technology. The process is inserting a human gene into a bacterial plasmid so that the bacteria can produce human growth hormone. The steps involve cutting the gene out of the human cell, inserting it into the plasmid, and then introducing that plasmid back into the bacterial cell. The bacteria then use their own replication machinery to produce the growth hormone. This is similar to how insulin is produced using genetically modified bacteria in biotechnology.

Wait, but the human cell is just providing the gene, not the actual hormone. The bacteria take over the production. So the process is cloning the gene in the bacteria, which then express it. That makes sense. The figure is illustrating the process of creating a recombinant DNA molecule in bacteria, which can then be used to produce a human protein. This is a common technique in biotechnology for producing therapeutic proteins like growth hormone, insulin, etc.

The process illustrated in the figure is **recombinant DNA technology** or **gene cloning**. Here's the breakdown:

1. **Gene Extraction**: The human growth hormone gene is isolated from a human cell (step 2).
2. **Plasmid Modification**: The gene is inserted into a bacterial plasmid (step 4), which serves as a vector for genetic material.
3. **Transformation**: The modified plasmid is reintroduced into a bacterial cell (step 5).
4. **Replication**: The bacterial cell uses its replication machinery to replicate the plasmid along with its DNA (steps 6â€“7).
5. **Expression**: The bacteria produce human growth hormone, which is then secreted or stored within the cells.

This process enables the production of therapeutic proteins in bacteria, leveraging their rapid replication to generate large quantities of the desired protein. The figure demonstrates how genetic material from one organism is introduced into another to achieve a specific biological outcome. 

**Answer:** Recombinant DNA technology.
