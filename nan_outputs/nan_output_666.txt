Okay, let's see. The question is asking which group didn't experience an increase in unemployment over the five-month period shown in the graph. The options are A through D, with E being that all groups showed a rise. 

First, I need to understand the graph. It's a line graph with different levels of education on the y-axis (number of unemployed workers in thousands) and months from June to October on the x-axis. Each line represents a different education level: less than a high school diploma, high school diploma no college, some college, and bachelor's degree or higher.

Looking at each line:

1. **Less than a high school diploma**: This line starts at around 12.5 thousand in June and decreases slightly to about 12 thousand in July, then stays around 12 thousand in August, September, and October. So it's decreasing overall but not rising.

2. **High school diploma, no college**: Starts at about 8.5 thousand in June, stays around 8.5 in July, then increases to 9 thousand in August, stays at 9 in September, and then decreases to 8.5 in October. So this group has a slight increase in August and September but overall is decreasing.

3. **Some college**: Starts at around 7.5 thousand in June, decreases to 7 thousand in July, stays around 7 in August, then increases to 7.5 in September, and decreases again to 7 in October. So this group has a slight decrease overall.

4. **Bachelor's degree or higher**: Starts at 4 thousand in June, stays at 4 in July, August, September, and October. So this group remains constant throughout the period.

Now, the question is asking which group saw no rise. Let's check each option:

A. Workers without a high school diploma: The line for this group is decreasing, so no rise. But the answer might not be A because the question is looking for the only group that didn't rise. Wait, but maybe more than one group didn't rise? Let me check again.

B. High school graduates with no college education: Their line starts at 8.5, goes up to 9 in August, then back down. So they had a rise in August but overall decreased. So they did have a rise, so B is not the answer.

C. Workers with some college education: Their line decreases overall, so no rise. But again, maybe more than one group didn't rise.

D. Workers with a bachelor's degree or higher: Their line is flat, staying at 4 throughout. So no rise here. But the question says "the only group that saw no rise." If more than one group didn't rise, then D might not be correct. Wait, let's check all groups.

Looking at all lines:

- Less than high school: Decreasing.
- High school: Slight increase then decrease.
- Some college: Decreasing.
- Bachelor's: Flat.

So only the bachelor's group didn't have any rise. The other groups either had a rise (high school) or a decrease (others). Therefore, the answer should be D. But wait, the options are A to E. Let me check again.

Wait, the options are:

A. Workers without a high school diploma

B. High school graduates with no college education

C. Workers with some college education

D. Workers with a bachelor's degree or higher

E. All groups showed a rise.

So the correct answer is D, because only the bachelor's group didn't have any rise. The other groups either had a rise (high school) or a decrease (others). So the only group that saw no rise is D. Therefore, the answer is D.

The graph shows unemployment trends across four education levels. The group with a **bachelor's degree or higher** (line at 4 thousand) remained constant throughout the five-month period, experiencing no rise. Other groups either saw a slight increase (high school diploma) or a decrease (less than high school, some college). Thus, the only group that did not experience an unemployment rise is:

**D. Workers with a bachelor's degree or higher**
