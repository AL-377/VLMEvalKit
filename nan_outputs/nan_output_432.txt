Okay, let's see. The question is asking to calculate China's GDP using the expenditure approach. Hmm, I remember that the expenditure approach adds up all the different components of spending in the economy. The formula is GDP = Consumption + Investment + Government Expenditure + Net Exports. Wait, but in the table, they have exports and imports. So net exports would be exports minus imports, right? Because net exports are the difference between what a country sells to others and what it buys from others. So exports minus imports.

Let me check the numbers again. Consumption is 1700 billion, investment is 700, government expenditure is 100. Exports are 50, imports are 40. So net exports would be 50 - 40 = 10. Then adding all those up: 1700 + 700 + 100 + 10. Let me add them step by step. 1700 + 700 is 2400. Then 2400 + 100 is 2500. Then 2500 + 10 is 2510. So the total GDP should be 2510 billion. Let me check the options. Option A is 2510, B is 2500, C is 2410. So the answer should be A. But wait, let me make sure I didn't mix up any numbers. Consumption is 1700, investment 700, government 100, exports 50, imports 40. Yes, net exports is 10. Adding all together: 1700+700=2400, 2400+100=2500, 2500+10=2510. That seems right. So the correct answer is A.

To calculate China's GDP using the expenditure approach, we sum all components of spending: Consumption, Investment, Government Expenditure, and Net Exports (Exports - Imports). 

- **Consumption**: 1700 billion  
- **Investment**: 700 billion  
- **Government Expenditure**: 100 billion  
- **Exports**: 50 billion  
- **Imports**: 40 billion  

**Net Exports**: \( 50 - 40 = 10 \) billion  

Adding these together:  
\( 1700 + 700 + 100 + 10 = 2510 \) billion.  

**Answer**: A. 2510
