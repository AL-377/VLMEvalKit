Okay, let's see. The question is about the relationship type of WORKS_ON in the given diagram. The options are 1:1, 1:N, N:1, N:M, or none of the others. Hmm. 

First, I need to recall what each of these relationship types means. A 1:1 relationship means that each entity in one set is related to exactly one entity in the other set, and vice versa. For example, a student can only have one ID, and each ID is for one student. 

1:N is one entity to many in the other. Like, one department has many employees, but each employee is in only one department. 

N:1 is the reverse; many entities in one set relate to one in the other. 

N:M is a many-to-many relationship, where each entity can have multiple relationships with other entities. 

Now, looking at the diagram. There are three tables: EMPLOYEE, WORKS_FOR, and DEPARTMENT. The WORKS_FOR table has relationships between EMPLOYEE and DEPARTMENT. 

In the diagram, each employee (e1 to e7) is connected to multiple departments (d1, d2, d3). For example, e1 is connected to d1, d2, and d3. Similarly, e2 is connected to d1 and d2. So each employee can work for multiple departments. 

On the other hand, each department (d1, d2, d3) is connected to multiple employees. For instance, d1 is connected to e1, e2, e3, etc. So each department has multiple employees. 

Therefore, the relationship between EMPLOYEE and DEPARTMENT is many-to-many. Because each employee can be in multiple departments, and each department can have multiple employees. 

So the answer should be D. N:M. Let me double-check. If it were 1:N, then each employee would be in only one department, but the diagram shows multiple departments per employee. Similarly, if it were N:1, each department would have only one employee, which isn't the case here. 1:1 would mean each employee is in exactly one department and each department has exactly one employee, which isn't the case. So yes, N:M is correct.

The relationship between EMPLOYEE and DEPARTMENT in the diagram is many-to-many (N:M), as each employee can work for multiple departments, and each department can have multiple employees. 

**Answer:** D. N:M
