Okay, let's see. The question is asking what is NOT exhibited in the painting. The options are A. hierarchical scale, B. graphic representation of horror and despair, C. a sense of immediacy and drama, D. use of sharply contrasting light and shade.

First, I need to recall what I know about this painting. The image looks familiar. It's a famous painting by Théodore Géricault, I think, called "The Raft of the Medusa." If I remember correctly, this painting depicts a real event where a shipwreck occurred, and survivors clung to a raft for days, leading to many deaths. The painting is known for its dramatic and realistic depiction of horror and despair.

Now, let's go through each option. 

Option A: Hierarchical scale. Hmm. In art, hierarchical scale refers to the way figures are arranged in a composition to show their importance. For example, a larger figure in the foreground might represent a more significant person. In "The Raft of the Medusa," the composition is quite chaotic. The central figure, often identified as the artist himself, is at the center, but the overall arrangement is more about the struggle and chaos rather than a clear hierarchy. So maybe the artist didn't use a strict hierarchical scale here. That could be a reason why A is not exhibited.

Option B: Graphic representation of horror and despair. The painting is famous for its depiction of the survivors' suffering. The figures are depicted in a way that shows their physical and emotional distress. So B seems to be present.

Option C: A sense of immediacy and drama. The painting is known for its intense, dramatic atmosphere. The chaotic composition, the stormy sky, and the desperate expressions of the figures all contribute to a sense of immediacy. So C is likely present.

Option D: Use of sharply contrasting light and shade. The painting uses chiaroscuro, which is the contrast between light and dark. The sky is dark and stormy, while the figures are illuminated, creating a strong contrast. So D is present.

Therefore, the answer should be A. Hierarchical scale. The painting doesn't exhibit a strict hierarchical scale because the composition is more about chaos and survival rather than ranking the figures by importance.

The painting "The Raft of the Medusa" by Théodore Géricault is renowned for its dramatic and realistic depiction of horror and despair. Here's the analysis of the options:

- **A. Hierarchical scale**: The composition prioritizes chaos and survival over formal hierarchy. Figures are not arranged to emphasize rank or importance, making this option **not exhibited**.  
- **B. Graphic representation of horror and despair**: The painting vividly portrays the physical and emotional suffering of the survivors, making this **exhibited**.  
- **C. A sense of immediacy and drama**: The chaotic arrangement, stormy sky, and desperate expressions create an intense, urgent atmosphere, so this is **exhibited**.  
- **D. Use of sharply contrasting light and shade**: Chiaroscuro is evident with the dark sky and illuminated figures, so this is **exhibited**.  

**Answer**: A. Hierarchical scale
