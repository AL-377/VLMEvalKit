Okay, so I need to figure out who designed this chair and then determine their nationality from the options given. Let me start by looking at the chair itself. It's a very modern-looking piece with clean lines, bold colors, and a minimalist design. The seat and backrest are in two distinct colors, red and blue, which is quite striking. The armrests are a different color, maybe yellow or gold, and the legs are black with some gold accents. The overall structure seems to be made of metal and wood, giving it a sturdy yet stylish appearance.

Now, I remember that this chair is a classic piece in design history. The style reminds me of the De Stijl movement, which was popular in the early 20th century. The De Stijl movement emphasized simplicity, geometric shapes, and primary colors, which aligns with the chair's design. The chair's name is the Red and Blue Chair, right? I think it's associated with the architect and designer Gerrit Rietveld.

Let me recall more details. Rietveld was a Dutch architect and furniture designer. He's known for his innovative designs that blend functionality with art. The Red and Blue Chair was part of his early work, created around 1917. It's a pivotal piece that showcases his use of primary colors and geometric forms. The chair's design is both functional and artistic, which is characteristic of his style.

So, if the designer is Dutch, then the answer would be option B. Let me cross-check the options. The options are A. American, B. Dutch, C. German, D. French. Since Rietveld was Dutch, B is correct. I don't think any of the other nationalities are associated with this particular chair. The other options might be related to other designers or movements, but this chair is definitely linked to Rietveld.
