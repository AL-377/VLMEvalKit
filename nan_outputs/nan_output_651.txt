Okay, let's see. The question is about identifying a term that refers to traditional folktales with a contemporary twist or a new perspective, like the ones mentioned: "There's a Wolf at the Door" and "The Adventures of the Dish and the Spoon." The options are A. Legends, B. Fractured Folktales, C. Humorous Tale, D. Retold Tale.

First, I need to recall what each term means. Legends are stories that are passed down through generations, often about heroes or events, but they might not necessarily be traditional folktales. Fractured Folktales, I remember, are stories that take existing folktales and twist them, changing the characters or the plot. Humorous Tale is just a story that's funny, not necessarily connected to traditional tales. Retold Tale is when a traditional tale is told again, maybe with different details, but not necessarily a twist.

The examples given, "There's a Wolf at the Door" and "The Adventures of the Dish and the Spoon," sound like they're taking classic tales and giving them a modern spin. For instance, "There's a Wolf at the Door" might be a variation of "Little Red Riding Hood," but with a twist. Similarly, "The Adventures of the Dish and the Spoon" could be a retelling of a traditional tale where the main characters are everyday objects, which is a common trope in fractured folktales.

So, if I think about the options, Fractured Folktales (B) seems to fit because they take traditional tales and fracture them, changing elements. Retold Tale (D) is more about telling the same story again, maybe with different details, but not necessarily a twist. Humorous Tale (C) is too vague. Legends (A) are about heroes or events, not necessarily traditional tales with a twist.

Therefore, the correct answer should be B. Fractured Folktales.

The term that refers to traditional folktales with a contemporary twist or a new perspective, such as "There's a Wolf at the Door" and "The Adventures of the Dish and the Spoon," is **Fractured Folktales**. These stories rework classic tales by altering characters, plots, or perspectives, creating a modern reinterpretation. 

**Answer:** B. Fractured Folktales
