Okay, let's see. The question is asking about lines that give the impression of calm and tranquility, like those found in the ocean or open prairies. The options are A. Diagonal line, B. Horizontal line, C. Vertical line, and D. List spacing. Hmm.

First, I need to recall what each type of line does. Diagonal lines usually create a sense of movement or energy, right? Like a diagonal stripe on a flag or a staircase. So that might not be calm. Vertical lines can make things look tall or imposing, maybe like a skyscraper. So that's probably not calm either. Then horizontal lines... think about the horizon in a landscape. The ocean meets the sky, and that's a flat, calm line. Open prairies also have flat, expansive areas. So horizontal lines often represent calmness because they're stable and spread out. 

Wait, the options also include "List spacing" as D. That's probably a trick option. Maybe they're trying to confuse between list spacing and horizontal lines? But list spacing is about the space between lines in text, not a line itself. So D is probably a distractor. 

So between A, B, and C. Diagonal and vertical are out. Horizontal lines are the ones that make you think of calm, open spaces. So the answer should be B. Horizontal line.
