Okay, let's see. The question is about calculating the attributable risk (AR) from this cohort study data. The options are given, so I need to figure out which one is correct. 

First, I remember that attributable risk is the difference in incidence between the exposed and unexposed groups. So AR = (Incidence in exposed group - Incidence in unexposed group). But wait, the answer options are in different forms. Let me check the data again.

Looking at the table, the exposure group has 58 cases out of 100,000, so the incidence is 58 per 100,000. The non-exposed group has 5 cases out of 100,000, so 5 per 100,000. The question is asking for the attributable risk, which is the excess risk due to exposure. So AR should be 58 - 5 = 53 per 100,000. 

But wait, the options are given as A. 11.6, B. 53.0/100000, C. 63.0/100000, D. 0.91. So 53.0/100000 is option B. That seems straightforward. But let me double-check. Maybe I'm missing something here.

Attributable risk is also sometimes calculated as (Incidence in exposed - Incidence in unexposed) * Prevalence. But in this case, the prevalence isn't given. The data is incidence rates, not prevalence. So since the study is prospective, the incidence is already the rate per 100,000. So AR is indeed 58 - 5 = 53 per 100,000. So the answer should be B. 

But wait, let me check the options again. Option C is 63.0/100000. That's 63 per 100,000. Hmm. Maybe I made a mistake here. Let me think again. 

Wait, maybe the question is asking for the absolute risk reduction (ARR) instead of AR? But no, AR is the excess risk. Alternatively, maybe the question is in terms of risk difference. But in this case, since both groups are in the same population (100,000 each), the AR is just the difference in incidence rates. 

Alternatively, maybe the question is using a different formula. Let me recall: AR is the difference in incidence between exposed and unexposed. So yes, 58 - 5 = 53. So 53 per 100,000. So B is correct. 

But let me check the options again. Option B is 53.0/100000, which is 53 per 100,000. So that's correct. Option C is 63.0/100000, which would be 63 per 100,000. That's higher than the actual difference. So maybe there's a mistake here. Wait, maybe the question is asking for the relative risk instead? But no, the options don't include relative risk. 

Alternatively, maybe the question is in terms of risk ratio. But again, not in the options. So I think B is the correct answer. 

Wait, but let me check the data again. The exposure group has 58 cases, non-exposed 5. So 58 - 5 = 53. So AR is 53 per 100,000. So B is correct. Therefore, the answer is B.

The attributable risk (AR) is calculated as the difference in incidence between the exposed and unexposed groups. 

- **Exposed group incidence**: 58 cases / 100,000 = 58 per 100,000  
- **Non-exposed group incidence**: 5 cases / 100,000 = 5 per 100,000  

**AR** = 58 - 5 = **53 per 100,000**.  

**Answer**: B. 53.0/100000
