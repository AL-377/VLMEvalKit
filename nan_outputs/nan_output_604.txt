Okay, let's see. The question is asking why countries of Eastern Europe joined the EU later than other European Union members. The options are A through D. Let me go through each one.

First, the options. A says support of agrarian populations for protectionist trade policies. Hmm, Eastern European countries might have had agrarian populations, but does that directly explain why they joined later? Maybe not. Protectionist policies could be a reason for not joining earlier, but the timing seems more about political and historical factors rather than economic policies. Unless the agrarian populations were more resistant to EU integration, but I'm not sure. Maybe not the main reason.

Option B: Control by the Soviet Union until the end of the Cold War. That makes sense. Eastern Europe was part of the Soviet bloc during the Cold War. The EU was a Western organization, so countries under Soviet control might have been reluctant to join. The end of the Cold War in 1991, with the fall of the Berlin Wall, would have allowed these countries to start considering EU membership. So that could be a factor. But is this the best explanation?

Option C: Resistance to the West by fascist governments. Hmm. Eastern European countries after World War II had communist governments, not fascist. The fascists were in Italy, Spain, and parts of Eastern Europe like Hungary and Romania, but after the war, those countries became communist. So maybe this is not accurate. Also, resistance to the West would be more about political ideology rather than EU membership. So probably not C.

Option D: The greater effect of the Great Depression and world wars on those countries. The Great Depression was in the 1930s, and World War II was in the 1940s. Eastern European countries were affected by both, but so were Western countries. However, the EU was founded in 1993, so the Great Depression and World War II are too early. Plus, the EU is about reducing trade barriers, so economic effects from those events might not directly explain why they joined later. Maybe, but it's not the main reason.

So, B seems the best answer. The Eastern European countries were under Soviet control until the end of the Cold War, which delayed their EU membership. The fall of the Soviet Union in 1991 allowed them to start considering EU integration. The other options either don't fit the time frame or are not the primary reasons. So the answer should be B.

The correct answer is **B. Control of those countries by the Soviet Union until the end of the Cold War**. Eastern European countries were part of the Soviet bloc during the Cold War, which delayed their EU membership. The fall of the Soviet Union in 1991 enabled these nations to join the EU, as they were no longer under direct control. Other options (A, C, D) either mischaracterize historical contexts or focus on economic factors that are not the primary cause of delayed admission. 

**Answer:** B. Control of those countries by the Soviet Union until the end of the Cold War
