Okay, let's see. The question is asking which mineral is the hardest among the options given. The options are feldspar, fluorite, galena, and quartz. The table provided has hardness values for each mineral. 

First, I need to look at the hardness column. Let me check each one. 

Feldspar is listed as 6-6.5. Fluorite is 4. Galena is 2.5-2.75. Quartz is 7. So, comparing these numbers: 7 is the highest. That would mean quartz is the hardest. 

Wait, but let me make sure I didn't mix up any numbers. Feldspar is 6-6.5, which is lower than 7. Fluorite is 4, which is even lower. Galena is 2.5-2.75, which is the lowest. So yes, quartz has the highest hardness at 7. 

Therefore, the answer should be D. quartz.

The mineral with the highest hardness value is Quartz, rated at 7. The other minerals have lower hardness values: Feldspar (6–6.5), Fluorite (4), and Galena (2.5–2.75). 

**Answer:** D. quartz
