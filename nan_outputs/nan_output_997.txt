Okay, so I need to figure out which food is the most likely cause of the food poisoning outbreak based on the given table. Let me start by understanding the data provided. 

The table has five foods: cold chicken, potato salad, egg sandwiches, fruit pie and cream, and cheese. For each food, there are two numbers: the number of people who ate that food, and the number who got sick after eating it. The goal is to determine which food has the highest proportion of people who got sick, as that would indicate the most likely cause of the outbreak.

First, I should calculate the percentage of people who got sick for each food. To do this, I'll take the number of people who got sick and divide it by the total number of people who ate that food, then multiply by 100 to get the percentage. Let me write that down for each item.

Starting with cold chicken: 34 people got sick out of 86 who ate it. So, 34/86 = 0.3953... which is approximately 39.53%.

Next, potato salad: 38 out of 54. 38/54 = 0.7037... which is about 70.37%.

Egg sandwiches: 40 out of 76. 40/76 = 0.5263... or 52.63%.

Fruit pie and cream: 12 out of 32. 12/32 = 0.375, which is 37.5%.

Cheese: 12 out of 48. 12/48 = 0.25, which is 25%.

Now, comparing these percentages: potato salad has the highest at 70.37%, followed by egg sandwiches at 52.63%, then cold chicken at 39.53%, fruit pie and cream at 37.5%, and cheese at 25%. 

But wait, the question is asking which food is the most likely cause. So, the one with the highest percentage of people getting sick. Since potato salad has the highest percentage, that would be the answer. Let me double-check the calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.

Cold chicken: 34/86. Let me compute that again. 86 divided by 34 is 2.529, so 34 divided by 86 is 0.3953, yes. Potato salad: 38/54. 54 divided by 38 is approximately 1.421, so 38/54 is about 0.7037. Correct. Egg sandwiches: 40/76. 76 divided by 40 is 1.9, so 40/76 is 0.5263. Correct. Fruit pie and cream: 12/32 is 0.375. Cheese: 12/48 is 0.25. All correct.

So, yes, potato salad has the highest percentage. Therefore, the answer should be option B.

To determine the most likely cause of the food poisoning outbreak, we calculate the percentage of people who got sick for each food:

- **Cold chicken**: \( \frac{34}{86} \times 100 \approx 39.53\% \)  
- **Potato salad**: \( \frac{38}{54} \times 100 \approx 70.37\% \)  
- **Egg sandwiches**: \( \frac{40}{76} \times 100 \approx 52.63\% \)  
- **Fruit pie and cream**: \( \frac{12}{32} \times 100 = 37.5\% \)  
- **Cheese**: \( \frac{12}{48} \times 100 = 25\% \)  

The highest percentage is **70.37%** for potato salad.  

**Answer:** B. Potato salad
