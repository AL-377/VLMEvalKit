Okay, let's see. The question is asking what the symbol in the image represents, with options being Temple, Mosque, Hut, or Church. The image is a simple line drawing. Let me try to visualize it again. There's a rectangular base, which might represent the foundation or the ground. Then, there are two vertical lines on either side, which could be pillars or walls. On top of these vertical lines, there are two curved shapes that look like domes or arches. In the center, there's a smaller rectangle, maybe a door or an entrance. 

Hmm. Let's think about each option. A Temple is a place of worship, often with columns and a roof. A Mosque is similar but usually has a dome and minarets. A Hut is a simple, small shelter, maybe made of wood or thatch. A Church is a Christian place of worship, often with a cross or other religious symbols.

Looking at the structure here: the two vertical lines with domes on top. In Islamic architecture, mosques often have domes and minarets. The domes are a key feature. The two vertical lines could be minarets, which are tall towers used for calling people to prayer. The domes on top of the vertical structures would make sense for a mosque. The smaller rectangle in the center might be an entrance or a mihrab, which is a niche in the wall facing Mecca. 

Temple usually has columns and a roof, but not necessarily domes. A church might have a cross, but the structure here doesn't show a cross. A hut is too simple and doesn't have the architectural elements like domes and minarets. So, combining the domes, minarets, and the overall structure, it's more likely a Mosque. The two curved shapes on top of the vertical lines are domes, which are characteristic of mosques. The presence of the two vertical structures could be minarets. The central rectangle might be the entrance or a part of the prayer hall. So, the answer should be B. Mosque.

The symbol features two vertical structures with domes on top, which are characteristic of Islamic architecture. The domes and minaret-like structures align with the design of a mosque. The central rectangular element resembles a prayer hall entrance or mihrab. While a temple might have columns, a church typically includes crosses, and a hut lacks such architectural complexity. Thus, the correct answer is:

**B. Mosque**
