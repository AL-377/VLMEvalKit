Okay, so I need to figure out which artist created this painting. The image shows an angel and a woman, likely the Annunciation scene. The options are Masaccio, Piero della Francesca, Fra Angelico, and Giotto. Let me start by recalling each artist's style and known works.

First, Giotto. He's known for his early Renaissance works, like the Scrovegni Chapel in Padua. His style is more naturalistic and uses perspective, but I'm not sure if he's associated with this specific painting. The architecture here seems more classical, with columns and arches, which might be more in line with later artists.

Then there's Masaccio. He was a student of Giotto and is known for his use of linear perspective and more realistic human figures. His work "The Tribute Money" comes to mind, which uses perspective effectively. But does he have an Annunciation? I think he did, but maybe it's not as well-known as some others.

Piero della Francesca is another Renaissance artist, known for his mathematical approach to perspective and his use of light and shadow (chiaroscuro). His "Flagellation of Christ" is famous, but does he have an Annunciation? I'm not certain. Maybe not as much as the others.

Fra Angelico is known for his serene, almost otherworldly style. He often painted nuns and religious scenes, and his works are characterized by soft colors and a sense of calm. The Annunciation is a common subject for him, and his style might match the painting here. The angel's posture and the woman's expression seem gentle and contemplative, which aligns with Fra Angelico's known works.

Wait, the painting in the image has a lot of gold and a somewhat flat, almost Byzantine-like background. Fra Angelico's work often has a similar style, with gold backgrounds and halos. The architecture here also looks like a cloister or a religious setting, which fits with Fra Angelico's themes.

But I should also consider the other options. Masaccio's Annunciation might be less prominent, and Piero della Francesca's Annunciation might not be as well-documented. Giotto's Annunciation is possible, but I think it's more likely to be Fra Angelico's.

Another clue is the signature or inscription in the painting. The image shows a signature at the bottom, but I can't read it clearly. If it's in Italian, maybe it's the artist's name. If it's Fra Angelico, his signature might be there. But since I can't see it, that's a bit of a stretch.

Alternatively, the architectural style. The columns and arches are reminiscent of Romanesque or early Renaissance architecture. Fra Angelico was active in the 15th century, which is the early Renaissance, so that fits. Giotto was earlier, in the 14th century, so maybe not. Piero della Francesca was also in the 15th century, but his style is more mathematical and geometric.

So, putting it all together, the painting's style, the serene figures, the architectural elements, and the possible signature pointing to Fra Angelico. I think the answer is C. Fra Angelico.

The painting depicts the Annunciation, a common religious subject. The style, characterized by soft colors, gentle expressions, and a serene atmosphere, aligns with Fra Angelico's known works. The architectural elements, such as the columns and arches, are typical of early Renaissance settings, consistent with Fra Angelico's period (15th century). While other artists like Giotto, Masaccio, or Piero della Francesca are associated with Annunciation scenes, the combination of artistic style, subject matter, and architectural context most strongly points to **Fra Angelico**.  

**Answer:** C. Fra Angelico
