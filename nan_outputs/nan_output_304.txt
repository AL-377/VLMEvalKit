Okay, so I need to figure out the rhythm in this ECG. Let me start by recalling what each of these options means. 

First, the options are A to F, each representing different types of rhythms. Let me go through each one step by step.

Starting with A: Normal Sinus Rhythm. That's when the heart beats at a normal rate, typically between 60-100 bpm. The P waves are in the right place, and the PR interval is normal. But looking at the ECG here, the P waves are not clearly visible. Wait, maybe they are hidden in the QRS complexes? Let me check. The first few complexes have a P wave followed by a QRS, but then some of them don't have a P wave before the QRS. Hmm, that might not be normal sinus rhythm. Because in normal sinus rhythm, each QRS should be preceded by a P wave. If there's a QRS without a preceding P wave, that could be a problem. So maybe A is not correct.

Next, B: Sinus Bradycardia. That's when the heart rate is slow, less than 60 bpm. The P waves are normal, and the PR interval is normal. But again, if there are QRS complexes without P waves, that might not fit. Also, the PR interval here seems to be around 0.12 seconds, which is normal. But if there are dropped beats, that's not sinus bradycardia. So maybe B is not the answer.

C: Accelerated Junctional Rhythm. That's when the junctional rhythm is faster than the sinus node. The P waves are inverted in leads II, III, aVF. The PR interval is less than 0.12 seconds. In this ECG, the P waves are inverted in II, III, aVF, which is a sign of junctional rhythm. Also, the rate here seems to be around 70-80 bpm, which is faster than sinus bradycardia (which is slow). So if the junctional rate is faster than sinus, that would be accelerated junctional. But I need to check if the P waves are present before each QRS. Let me count. The first few have a P wave before QRS, then some don't. Wait, but in junctional rhythm, the P waves are usually present, but sometimes they can be buried in the QRS. However, in this case, the P waves are inverted in II, III, aVF, which is a key feature of junctional rhythm. So if the rate is faster than sinus (which is around 60-100), and the P waves are inverted, then C might be possible. But the options include NSR with 1st degree AV block (D), which could also have inverted P waves. Hmm.

D: NSR with 1st Degree AV Block. That's normal sinus rhythm with a prolonged PR interval (PR >0.20 seconds). But in this ECG, the PR interval is around 0.12 seconds, which is normal. So D is out.

E: Idioventricular Rhythm. That's a very slow rhythm, less than 40 bpm, with wide QRS complexes. The P waves are usually not visible. In this ECG, the rate is around 70-80 bpm, which is too fast for idioventricular. So E is unlikely.

F: Paced with Failure to Capture. That's when the atrial pacing is not captured by the ventricles. The P waves are present but the QRS is not following. In this ECG, the P waves are visible, but the QRS complexes are present. So F is not applicable here.

Wait, but let's double-check. The ECG shows a regular rhythm. The P waves are inverted in II, III, aVF, which is a sign of junctional rhythm. The rate is around 70-80 bpm, which is faster than sinus bradycardia (which is slow). So if the junctional rate is faster than sinus, then it's accelerated junctional rhythm. But sometimes, in junctional rhythm, the P waves can be buried in the QRS, but in this case, they are clearly inverted in the inferior leads. So that supports junctional rhythm. Also, the PR interval is normal (0.12 seconds), which is within normal limits. So if the junctional rate is faster than sinus, then C is the answer. But let me check the options again. The options are A to F. So C is Accelerated Junctional Rhythm. But wait, another possibility is that it's NSR with 1st degree AV block (D), but the PR interval here is normal. So D is out. So between C and the other options. 

Wait, but another thing to consider: sometimes, in junctional rhythm, the P waves can be inverted in the inferior leads, which is a key feature. So if the P waves are inverted in II, III, aVF, then it's junctional. The rate is faster than sinus, so it's accelerated junctional. Therefore, the answer should be C. But let me check the rhythm again. The P waves are inverted, so that's junctional. The rate is around 70-80, which is faster than sinus bradycardia (which is slow). So yes, C is correct. 

But wait, another thought: sometimes, in junctional rhythm, the P waves can be buried in the QRS, but in this case, they are clearly visible. So the answer is C.

The ECG shows a regular rhythm with inverted P waves in leads II, III, and aVF, which is characteristic of **Accelerated Junctional Rhythm** (C). The rate is faster than sinus bradycardia (60â€“100 bpm), and the P waves are inverted, confirming junctional origin. The PR interval is within normal limits (0.12 seconds), ruling out options like **1st Degree AV Block** (D). Other options (A, B, E, F) are inconsistent with the observed features. 

**Answer:** C. Accelerated Junctional Rhythm
