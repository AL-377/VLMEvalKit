Okay, so I need to figure out which cell type is shown in this image. The options are Eosinophil, Thrombocyte, Lymphocyte, Monocyte, or Neutrophil. Let me start by recalling what each of these cells looks like under a microscope.

First, Eosinophils are typically larger than neutrophils and have a bilobed nucleus. They stain pink with eosin, which is why they're called eosinophils. Their granules are eosinophilic, meaning they take up eosin stain. They're involved in allergic reactions and parasitic infections.

Thrombocytes are platelets, which are not cells but fragments of megakaryocytes. They're very small and don't have nuclei. So if the image doesn't show a nucleus, that might be a clue. But the options include Thrombocyte, so I need to check if the image has a nucleus.

Lymphocytes are a type of white blood cell, and they have a large, round nucleus with a prominent nucleolus. They're involved in the immune system. They can be B cells, T cells, or natural killer cells. The nucleus is usually more prominent than the cytoplasm.

Monocytes are larger than lymphocytes and have a kidney-shaped or multi-lobed nucleus. They're part of the immune system and can become macrophages. Their cytoplasm is abundant and sometimes has azurophilic granules.

Neutrophils are the most common type of white blood cell. They have a segmented nucleus (like a "sausage" shape) and are involved in phagocytosis. Their cytoplasm contains granules that stain purple with hematoxylin and eosin.

Looking at the image, the cell in question has a large, round nucleus with a prominent nucleolus. The cytoplasm is relatively abundant but not as much as a monocyte. The nucleus is definitely prominent, which is characteristic of lymphocytes. Eosinophils have a bilobed nucleus, so that's not it. Thrombocytes are platelets, which are not cells with nuclei. Monocytes have a multi-lobed nucleus, which isn't here. Neutrophils have a segmented nucleus, which also isn't the case here. So the large, round nucleus with a prominent nucleolus points to a lymphocyte. Therefore, the answer should be C. Lymphocyte.

The cell in the image has a large, round nucleus with a prominent nucleolus, characteristic of lymphocytes. Eosinophils have a bilobed nucleus, thrombocytes lack nuclei, monocytes have multi-lobed nuclei, and neutrophils have segmented nuclei. Thus, the correct answer is:

**C. Lymphocyte**
