Okay, so I need to figure out the common term for the yellow area surrounding the infection site on the leaf. Let me look at the image again. The leaf has a brownish spot in the center, and around it, there's a yellowish border. The options are A to E. 

First, I remember that when a plant is infected, sometimes there's a zone of discoloration around the infection. I think this is called a "halo." Let me think. A halo is like a ring around something, right? So if the infection is in the center, and the surrounding area is yellow, that would be a halo. 

But wait, let me check the other options. "Corona" sounds too fancy, maybe not. "Border" is too vague. "Toxin zone" is about toxins, but the term for the area around the infection. "I don't know" is an option, but I should try to recall. 

I think in plant pathology, the term for that yellow ring is a "halo." It's the area where the pathogen has killed the cells, and the surrounding tissue is affected but not dead yet, turning yellow. So the correct answer should be D, Halo.

The yellow area surrounding the infection site on the leaf is known as a **halo**. This term describes the zone of discoloration where the pathogen has caused cell death, while the surrounding tissue remains viable but appears yellow. 

**Answer:** D. Halo
