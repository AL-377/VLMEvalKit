Okay, so I need to figure out who created this painting. The options are Paul Cézanne, Edvard Munch, Edgar Degas, or Andy Warhol. Let me start by looking at the image provided. 

First, the painting has a dark, almost gloomy atmosphere. The figures are depicted in a somewhat distorted way, with exaggerated features and movements. The color palette is quite dark, with a lot of blacks and deep blues, but there are also some bright spots, like the yellow and orange areas. The brushstrokes seem thick and impasto, which is a technique where the paint is applied thickly, creating texture. 

Now, let me recall each artist's style. Paul Cézanne was known for his post-impressionist style, using bold colors and geometric forms. His works often have a sense of structure and order, even in his later works. He might have used more muted colors, but I don't see that here. Maybe his later works are more abstract, but this seems more figurative. 

Edvard Munch is famous for his expressionist works, often depicting psychological themes. His paintings are known for their intense emotional content, using stark colors and distorted figures. The painting I see here has a lot of emotion and movement, which fits Munch's style. The dark background and the figures in motion could be characteristic of his work. 

Edgar Degas was a French artist who worked in various media, including painting, sculpture, and photography. He's known for his portraits and scenes of ballet dancers. His style is more realistic with a focus on movement and light. The figures in this painting seem a bit too distorted and abstract for Degas. His works are more about capturing the moment rather than exaggerated emotion. 

Andy Warhol is associated with pop art, which involves commercial and everyday objects. His works are often repetitive and use bright, bold colors. This painting doesn't seem to have that style. The colors here are more muted and the figures are not as stylized as Warhol's iconic works. 

So, considering the emotional intensity, the dark color scheme, and the distorted figures, it's more likely that this is an expressionist work. Edvard Munch's "The Scream" is a famous example of expressionism, but this painting seems different. However, the style here is similar to Munch's. The figures are in a state of panic or despair, which is characteristic of his work. 

Wait, but the options include Edgar Degas. Let me check again. Degas' works are more about movement and light, not so much about emotion and distortion. So maybe not. Cézanne's works are more structured and less abstract. Warhol's is pop art. So the answer is probably B. Edvard Munch.

The painting exhibits characteristics of **expressionism**, such as intense emotion, distorted figures, and a dark color palette. Among the options, **Edvard Munch** is renowned for his expressionist works, particularly his iconic "The Scream," which shares a similar emotional and psychological depth. While the painting's style is reminiscent of Munch's, it does not align with the more structured or abstract approaches of Paul Cézanne, Edgar Degas, or Andy Warhol. 

**Answer:** B. EDVARD MUNCH
