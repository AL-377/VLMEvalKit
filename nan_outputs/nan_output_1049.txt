Okay, let's try to figure out this question. The question is asking who found evidence that divorce has been normalized. The options are A. Postman, B. Oakley, C. Philips, D. Aries, E. Mitchell and Woodey.

First, I need to recall what "normalized" means. Normalization here probably refers to the process where divorce became more accepted or common in society. So, the question is about someone who studied or documented the trend of divorce becoming more common and accepted over time.

Now, thinking about social science research. Divorce rates have been increasing in many countries over the past few decades. I remember that there was a study or research that looked into this. Let me think. There's a term called "divorce normalization," which suggests that divorce is no longer seen as a taboo or a major crisis. Maybe someone did research on this.

Looking at the options: Postman (A) is a name I don't immediately recognize in the context of divorce research. Oakley (B) might be a surname, but I'm not sure. Philips (C) is another name, maybe a company? Not sure. Aries (D) is a zodiac sign, which doesn't make sense here. Mitchell and Woodey (E) sounds like a team or a partnership. Maybe they did some research together.

Wait, I recall that there was a study by a sociologist named Judith Oakley. She wrote a book called "Divorce: The Normalization of an Abnormality." That might be the one. If that's the case, then the answer would be B. Oakley.

Alternatively, maybe it's someone else. Let me think again. Another possibility is that it's a reference to the work of John A. Coleman, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, there's a study by Philip Cohen, but he's more known for his work on inequality. Hmm.

Wait, the question is about evidence that divorce has been normalized. So, if someone conducted research showing that divorce is now accepted, then that person would be the answer. Judith Oakley's work is known for challenging the idea that divorce is a personal crisis and showing that it's more socially accepted. So, if that's the case, then Oakley (B) is the correct answer.

Alternatively, maybe it's Mitchell and Woodey. Let me check if they have any connection to divorce research. Mitchell and Woodey could be a couple, but I don't recall any specific research by them on divorce normalization. Maybe they are authors of a book on divorce, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe it's a typo or a different name. Alternatively, maybe it's a play on words. Wait, "divorce" and "normalize" might relate to someone named "Divorce" or "Normal," but those are not names listed here.

Alternatively, maybe it's a reference to the "divorce rate" studies. For example, the CDC or other government statistics might show trends, but the question is about who found evidence, not just the data. So, the person who did the research or the study.

Given that, Judith Oakley's work is a classic in this area. Her book "Divorce: The Normalization of an Abnormality" was published in 1991, and it argues that divorce is no longer seen as a personal failure but as a normal life event. So, that would make her the person who found evidence that divorce has been normalized. Therefore, the answer should be B. Oakley.

The question asks who found evidence that divorce has been normalized. Divorce normalization refers to the acceptance of divorce as a societal norm. Judith Oakley's work, particularly her book *Divorce: The Normalization of an Abnormality* (1991), challenges the traditional view of divorce as a personal crisis and demonstrates its increasing acceptance. While other names like Mitchell and Woodey (E) or Postman (A) are not directly associated with this research, Oakley (B) is the correct answer as she systematically documented the trend of divorce becoming normalized through sociological analysis. 

**Answer:** B. Oakley
