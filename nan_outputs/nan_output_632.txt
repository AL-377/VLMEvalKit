Okay, let's see. The question is about a term that refers to a symbol recurring through a story. The options are Theme, Shape, Covers, and Motif. Hmm. I need to remember what each of these terms means in the context of literature or storytelling.

First, Theme. A theme is a central idea or message that runs through a story. It's more about the underlying message, like love, justice, etc. So if the question is about a symbol, not the overall message, then Theme might not be the right answer.

Next, Shape. That seems too vague. A shape is just the form of something. Unless it's a specific shape that's repeated, but the question is about a symbol, not the shape itself. So maybe not Shape.

Covers... That doesn't ring a bell. Maybe it's a typo or a trick option. Probably not the answer.

Motif. Ah, this is a term I remember from literature. A motif is a recurring symbol, idea, or image that has symbolic meaning. For example, a recurring flower in a story might be a motif. So if the question is about a symbol that repeats throughout the story, Motif would be the correct term. 

Let me double-check. Theme is about the message, so that's not it. Shape is the form, not the symbol. Covers... Maybe it's a play on words? Like "covers" as in covering the story, but that doesn't make sense. Motif is definitely the term for a recurring symbol. So the answer should be D. Motif.

The term that refers to a symbol recurring through a story is **D. Motif**. A motif is a recurring symbol or image with symbolic meaning, which ties the story together. 

**Answer:** D. Motif
