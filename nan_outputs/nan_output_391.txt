Okay, let's see. The question is asking which of the options is NOT associated with the condition shown in the image. The image is a histological slide, probably a H&E stain, showing a cluster of cells with a somewhat lobulated structure. The options are A to D: Carcinoma of the breast, Medullary carcinoma of the thyroid gland, Tricholemmomas of the face, and Macrocephaly.

First, I need to identify the type of tissue shown in the image. The cells are arranged in a somewhat lobulated pattern, which is typical of certain epithelial tumors. Let's think about each option.

Option A: Carcinoma of the breast. Breast carcinomas can be various types, but lobulated structures are common in some subtypes, like lobular carcinoma. However, lobular carcinoma is usually associated with a more diffuse pattern, while the image shows a cluster of cells. Maybe lobular carcinoma could have a lobulated appearance? I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, maybe it's a ductal carcinoma. But the image shows a cluster, which might be more suggestive of a medullary carcinoma.

Option B: Medullary carcinoma of the thyroid gland. Medullary carcinoma is a type of thyroid cancer that can have a solid or trabecular pattern. The cells might be arranged in a trabecular pattern, which could be lobulated. However, medullary carcinoma is less common than papillary or follicular. The image shows a cluster of cells, which might be similar to medullary carcinoma's appearance. But I need to be careful here.

Option C: Tricholemmomas of the face. Tricholemmomas are benign tumors that arise from the hair follicle infundibulum. They are usually located on the face, especially around the nose and lips. Histologically, they have a characteristic appearance with a clear cell component and a hyaline membrane. The image doesn't show clear cells or a hyaline membrane, so this might not be the right answer.

Option D: Macrocephaly. Macrocephaly refers to an abnormally large head. This is a systemic condition, not a specific tissue type. The image is a histological section, so macrocephaly is unrelated. Therefore, the answer should be D.

Wait, but let me double-check. The image shows a cluster of cells. Tricholemmomas are typically composed of clear cells with a hyaline membrane. The image doesn't show that. The cells here look more like epithelial cells, possibly with some stroma. Medullary carcinoma can have a trabecular pattern, which might be similar to a lobulated structure. Carcinoma of the breast could also have lobulated structures. But macrocephaly is a condition, not a tissue type. So the answer is D. Macrocephaly is unrelated to the histological image shown.

The histological image depicts a cluster of cells with a lobulated structure, characteristic of certain epithelial tumors. 

- **A. Carcinoma of the breast**: Lobulated patterns are seen in some subtypes, such as lobular carcinoma.  
- **B. Medullary carcinoma of the thyroid gland**: Trabecular or solid patterns can exhibit lobulated arrangements.  
- **C. Tricholemmomas of the face**: These benign tumors have clear cells and a hyaline membrane, not seen here.  
- **D. Macrocephaly**: This is a systemic condition, unrelated to tissue morphology.  

**Answer: D. Macrocephaly**
