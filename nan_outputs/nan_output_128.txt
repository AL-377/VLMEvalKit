Okay, let's see. The question is asking which image features a strong use of negative space. The options are A, B, C, D corresponding to Photos 1, 2, 2&3, and 3 respectively. I need to analyze each photo to determine which one has a significant amount of negative space.

Starting with Photo 1: It shows three women walking on a brick-paved area. The image is in black and white, and the women are silhouetted against the background. The negative space here would be the area around the women and the ground they're walking on. However, the negative space isn't particularly emphasized because the focus is on the figures themselves. The brick pattern might create some negative space, but it's not the main point. So maybe not the strongest use of negative space here.

Photo 2: This is a close-up of a light fixture with a cylindrical shape and a grid of small lights. The light fixture itself is the main subject, and the negative space would be the areas around the fixture and the shadows cast by the lights. The grid pattern creates a lot of small negative spaces between the lights. The overall effect might be interesting, but does it have a strong use of negative space? The lights are bright, so the negative space might be more defined by the dark areas around them. However, the main structure is the light fixture, so maybe the negative space is secondary. Not sure yet.

Photo 3: This is an architectural structure made of stacked bricks or blocks, forming two towers. The towers are tall and have a spiral or twisted shape. The negative space here would be the gaps between the blocks and the open areas around the towers. The structure is quite open, with a lot of negative space. The design might be intentional to create a sense of lightness or to allow air to pass through. The contrast between the solid structure and the open spaces makes this a strong example of negative space.

Now, considering the options: A is Photo 1, which might have some negative space but not as strong as Photo 3. Photo 2 has a lot of small negative spaces from the grid of lights, but the main subject is the light fixture, so the negative space might be more of a background element. Photo 3, on the other hand, is a structure where the negative space is a significant part of the design, creating a sense of openness and perhaps even a spiral effect. So the answer is likely D, Photo 3.

The question asks which image features a strong use of negative space. Negative space refers to the areas around and between objects, creating visual balance and emphasis. 

- **Photo 1** (silhouetted women) has some negative space but it is secondary to the figures themselves, and the brick pattern doesnâ€™t significantly highlight it.  
- **Photo 2** (light fixture) uses small negative spaces between lights, but the main focus is on the fixture, making the negative space less pronounced.  
- **Photo 3** (stacked brick towers) has a strong use of negative space. The spiral design and open structure create a sense of lightness and openness, with significant negative space contributing to the overall aesthetic.  

**Answer:** D. Photo 3
