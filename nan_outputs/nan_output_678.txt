Okay, let's see. The question is asking whether the store that had the fewest sales in May had higher total sales than the store with the most sales in May. Hmm. So first, I need to find the store with the lowest May sales and the one with the highest May sales, then compare their total sales for that month.

Looking at the table, under the May column for total sales (in thousands), I need to scan all the numbers. Let me go through each store's May total sales:

Ashford: $472k
Bennington: $498k
Carlisle: $465k
Depot: $456k
Eddington: $423k
Farpoint: $437k
Greenville: $508k
Harrington: $431k
Iverton: $479k
Jackson: $454k
Kiplinger: $450k
Landfield: $410k
Midville: $504k
Northfield: $437k
Overton: $489k
Princeville: $436k
Queensland: $480k
Riverton: $439k
Southland: $444k
Tuxedo: $408k

So the lowest May sales is Tuxedo at $408k, and the highest is Greenville at $508k. Now, I need to check if Tuxedo's May sales are higher than Greenville's. Wait, no, that's not possible. Greenville has the highest, so Tuxedo is the lowest. So the statement claims that the lowest had higher sales than the highest, which is false. Therefore, the answer should be B. False.

But wait, let me double-check. Maybe I missed a store with even lower sales? Let me check again. Ashford is $472, Bennington $498, Carlisle $465, Depot $456, Eddington $423, Farpoint $437, Greenville $508, Harrington $431, Iverton $479, Jackson $454, Kiplinger $450, Landfield $410, Midville $504, Northfield $437, Overton $489, Princeville $436, Queensland $480, Riverton $439, Southland $444, Tuxedo $408. Yes, Tuxedo is indeed the lowest. Greenville is the highest. So the statement is false. Therefore, the correct answer is B.

The store with the fewest sales in May (Tuxedo at $408k) had lower total sales than the store with the most sales in May (Greenville at $508k). Thus, the statement is **false**.

**Answer:** B. False
