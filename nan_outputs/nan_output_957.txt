Okay, let's see. The question is asking for the mean of data set A. The options are A through E, with numbers 3, 11, 12, 13, and 18. Hmm. To find the mean, I remember that you add up all the numbers in the data set and then divide by how many numbers there are. 

Looking at data set A: the numbers are 3, 4, 6, 12, 16, 17, and 19. Let me count them first. There are 7 numbers. So, I need to add all these numbers together. Let me do that step by step to make sure I don't make a mistake.

Starting with 3. Then adding 4: 3 + 4 = 7. Next, adding 6: 7 + 6 = 13. Then 12: 13 + 12 = 25. Then 16: 25 + 16 = 41. Then 17: 41 + 17 = 58. Finally, adding 19: 58 + 19 = 77. So the total sum is 77. 

Now, divide that by the number of data points, which is 7. So 77 divided by 7. Let me calculate that. 7 times 11 is 77, right? Because 7*10=70 and 7*1=7, so 70+7=77. So 77 divided by 7 is 11. 

Wait, so the mean is 11. Let me check the options again. Option B is 11. So that should be the correct answer. Let me just verify my addition again to be sure. 

3 + 4 is 7. 7 + 6 is 13. 13 + 12 is 25. 25 + 16 is 41. 41 + 17 is 58. 58 + 19 is 77. Yep, that's correct. Divided by 7, 77/7 is indeed 11. So the mean of data set A is 11. Therefore, the answer is B.

To determine the mean of data set A, we first sum all its values and then divide by the number of values. 

Data set A: 3, 4, 6, 12, 16, 17, 19  
Sum:  
3 + 4 = 7  
7 + 6 = 13  
13 + 12 = 25  
25 + 16 = 41  
41 + 17 = 58  
58 + 19 = 77  

Total sum = 77.  
Number of values = 7.  
Mean = 77 รท 7 = 11.  

**Answer:** B. 11
