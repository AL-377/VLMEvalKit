Okay, let's try to figure out this question. So, the scenario is a 53-year-old man who had cardiac arrest, then resuscitation efforts, and then a thrombolytic agent was given upon admission. The question is asking which cellular change is most likely occurring in his myocardium now. The options are apoptosis, free radical injury, heterophagocytosis, or squamous metaplasia.

First, let's break down the information. He had cardiac arrest, which means his heart stopped beating. Then they did resuscitation, which includes CPR and maybe defibrillation. After about 40 minutes, they established a regular heart rate. Then he was given a thrombolytic agent, which is something like tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) used to dissolve blood clots. So, the thrombolytic is given to break down the clot that caused the heart attack, right?

Now, the question is about cellular changes in the myocardium (heart muscle) after this. Let's think about each option.

Option A: Apoptosis. Apoptosis is programmed cell death. It's a normal process, like when cells die off during development. But in a heart attack, the cells that die are usually due to necrosis, which is non-programmed cell death. So maybe apoptosis isn't the main thing here. Unless the thrombolytic is causing some programmed cell death, but I'm not sure. Maybe not the primary answer.

Option B: Free radical injury. Free radicals are reactive oxygen species (ROS) that can damage cells. When there's ischemia-reperfusion injury, which happens when the heart is deprived of oxygen (ischemia) and then blood flow is restored (reperfusion), this can cause free radical damage. The thrombolytic might help restore blood flow, leading to reperfusion injury. So free radical injury could be a possibility here. But is this the most likely cellular change?

Option C: Heterophagocytosis. That's when a cell engulfs another cell. I'm not sure what context this would be in. Maybe in some inflammatory processes? Not sure. Maybe not the right answer.

Option D: Squamous metaplasia. Metaplasia is when one type of cell turns into another. Squamous metaplasia would be when cells become squamous, like epithelial cells. But in the heart, squamous metaplasia doesn't make much sense. Maybe in other organs, but not the heart. So probably not.

So, considering the timeline: cardiac arrest, resuscitation, then thrombolytic. The thrombolytic is given to dissolve the clot. The most common cause of cardiac arrest is a myocardial infarction (heart attack) due to a coronary artery blockage. So the thrombolytic is to break down the clot. After that, the heart is being reperfused, meaning blood flow is restored. So reperfusion injury is a possibility here. Reperfusion injury involves free radicals causing damage. So free radical injury (B) seems plausible.

Apoptosis (A) is less likely because the main cell death here is necrosis. Unless the thrombolytic is causing some programmed cell death, but I don't think so. Heterophagocytosis (C) is probably not relevant. Squamous metaplasia (D) is unlikely in the heart.

Therefore, the answer is B: Free radical injury.

The scenario involves a 53-year-old man with cardiac arrest, resuscitation, and thrombolytic agent administration upon admission. The key events are ischemia followed by reperfusion (thrombolytic-induced blood flow restoration). Reperfusion injury typically involves reactive oxygen species (free radicals) causing cellular damage. Apoptosis (programmed cell death) is less likely due to the primary necrosis from ischemia. Heterophagocytosis and squamous metaplasia are unrelated to myocardial changes in this context. 

**Answer:** B. Free radical injury.
