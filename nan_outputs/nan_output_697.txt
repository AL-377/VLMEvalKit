Okay, let's try to figure out this question. The question is asking what does not sustainability mean to humans, with options A to D. The options are environmental, personal consumption, social dimensions, and responsible resource management. 

First, I need to recall what sustainability means. From what I remember, sustainability is about meeting the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs. It involves three main pillars: environmental, social, and economic. So, the answer should be the one that's not one of these pillars.

Looking at the options:
A. Environmental – that's definitely part of sustainability. It's about preserving the environment for future generations.
B. Personal consumption – Hmm, this one is a bit tricky. Personal consumption is related to how individuals use resources. But does it fit into the three pillars? The environmental pillar is about the environment, the social is about people, and the economic is about the economy. Personal consumption could be part of the economic aspect, but maybe it's more about individual behavior rather than a broader pillar. Wait, but the three pillars are environmental, social, and economic. So maybe personal consumption isn't a pillar but rather a component within the economic pillar. So perhaps the answer is B.
C. Social dimensions – that's one of the three pillars. So that's part of sustainability.
D. Responsible resource management – that's part of the environmental pillar. So that's definitely a part of sustainability.

So the question is asking what does NOT sustainability mean to humans. So the answer should be the option that's not a pillar. Since personal consumption isn't one of the three pillars, but maybe it's a component within the economic pillar. However, the three pillars are environmental, social, and economic. Therefore, personal consumption might not be considered a pillar but rather a part of the economic pillar. Therefore, the answer would be B. Personal consumption. But wait, let me think again. Maybe the question is phrased differently. The options are given as possible meanings of sustainability. So if the three pillars are environmental, social, and economic, then personal consumption isn't a pillar. So the answer is B. But I need to make sure. Let me check again.

Wait, the three pillars of sustainability are environmental, social, and economic. So if the options are environmental, personal consumption, social dimensions, and responsible resource management. Then, environmental and social dimensions are pillars. Responsible resource management is part of environmental. So the only one that's not a pillar is personal consumption. Therefore, the answer is B. But I need to confirm. Alternatively, maybe the question is about what does NOT sustainability mean to humans, so if the options are the three pillars and another term, then the answer is the one that's not a pillar. So since personal consumption isn't a pillar, but maybe it's a component. But in the context of the question, the options are given as possible meanings. So if the three pillars are environmental, social, and economic, then personal consumption is not one of them. Therefore, the answer is B. But I need to check if "personal consumption" is considered a part of the economic pillar. Yes, because economic sustainability involves how resources are used and consumed. So personal consumption is part of the economic pillar. Therefore, the answer is B. So the correct answer is B.

The three pillars of sustainability are environmental, social, and economic. Among the options provided:

- **A. Environmental** and **C. Social dimensions** are explicitly part of the sustainability framework.  
- **D. Responsible resource management** falls under the environmental pillar.  
- **B. Personal consumption** is a component of the economic pillar but is not one of the three foundational pillars.  

Thus, **personal consumption** does not directly represent a core aspect of sustainability as defined by the three pillars.  

**Answer:** B. personal consumption
