Okay, let's see. The question is asking which Act of Parliament was passed in direct response to the Boston Tea Party. The options are A. Coercive Acts, B. Tea Act, C. Townshend Acts, D. Currency Act.

First, I need to recall what happened after the Boston Tea Party. The Tea Act was actually passed before the Boston Tea Party. The Tea Act of 1773 allowed the East India Company to sell tea directly to the colonies, which was a way to help them avoid paying the tax on tea. But the colonists were already upset about the Stamp Act and other taxes, so they didn't like this either. They dumped the tea into the harbor as a protest, which led to the Coercive Acts.

The Coercive Acts, also known as the Intolerable Acts, were passed in 1774. They were a series of laws that punished Massachusetts for the Boston Tea Party. They closed the port of Boston, restricted the rights of the Massachusetts legislature, and increased the power of the British governor. These acts were meant to show the colonies who was in charge.

The Townshend Acts were passed in 1767, which imposed taxes on various goods imported into the colonies, including tea. But the Tea Act of 1773 was a direct response to the colonists' reaction to the Townshend Acts. So the answer should be B. Tea Act. Wait, but the question says "in direct response to the events of the Boston Tea Party." The Tea Act was a response to the Townshend Acts, which were already in place. So maybe the answer is A. Coercive Acts, which were a direct response to the Boston Tea Party.

Wait, let me check again. The Boston Tea Party happened in 1773. The Townshend Acts were passed in 1767. The Tea Act was passed in 1773, but it was a response to the colonists' reaction to the Townshend Acts. The Coercive Acts were passed in 1774, after the Boston Tea Party, to punish Massachusetts. So the direct response to the Boston Tea Party would be the Coercive Acts. Therefore, the answer is A. Coercive Acts.

The Boston Tea Party occurred in 1773. The **Coercive Acts** (also known as the Intolerable Acts) were passed in **1774** in direct retaliation for the event. These acts punished Massachusetts and strengthened British control over the colonies. The **Tea Act** (1773) was a response to the Townshend Acts of 1767, not the Boston Tea Party. 

**Answer:** A. Coercive Acts
