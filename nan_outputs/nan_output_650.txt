Okay, let's see. The question is about identifying the type of plot structure used in "Charlotte's Web" from the given options. The options are Chronological plot, Episodic plot, Nonlinear plot, and Progressive plot. 

First, I need to recall what each of these terms means. A Chronological plot is one that follows the events in the order they happen in real time. So, like a story that starts at the beginning and moves forward step by step. Episodic plot is when the story is divided into separate episodes or segments, each focusing on a different event or time period. Nonlinear plot is when the story jumps around in time, maybe skipping ahead or going back. Progressive plot... Hmm, I'm not sure about that one. Maybe it's similar to chronological but with some progression?

Now, "Charlotte's Web" is a classic children's book. I remember that the story follows the life of a pig named Wilbur and his friend Charlotte the spider. The events unfold over time, starting from when Wilbur is a baby pig, then growing up, facing challenges, and Charlotte helping him. So the plot seems to be moving forward in time, with each chapter or section covering a specific period. The characters grow older, and the events happen sequentially. There's no jumping around in time; it's a straightforward progression from birth to adulthood. 

So if the answer is Chronological plot, that would make sense because the story is told in the order of events as they happen. Episodic would be if it was divided into separate episodes, like TV shows, but the book is a single continuous story. Nonlinear would be if it skipped around, but again, "Charlotte's Web" is told in a linear fashion. Progressive plot... Maybe that's another term for chronological? I think "progressive" here refers to the development of the characters or the story's progression, but the plot structure itself is chronological. 

Therefore, the correct answer should be A. Chronological plot.

The term used to describe a plot that covers events in chronological order, as seen in "Charlotte's Web," is **Chronological plot**. This structure follows the sequence of events as they occur in real time, progressing from the beginning to the end of the story. 

**Answer:** A. Chronological plot
