Okay, let's see. The question is asking who painted this famous artwork. The options are Edgar Degas, Vincent van Gogh, Gustav Klimt, and Claude Monet. I need to figure out which one it is.

First, I remember that this painting is one of Van Gogh's most famous works. The style seems to match his characteristic use of thick, swirling brushstrokes and vibrant colors. The scene depicted is a café terrace at night, which is a common subject for Van Gogh. He painted several versions of this exact scene in Arles, France, right?

Looking at the image, the night sky is a deep blue with stars, and the buildings have warm, yellowish tones. The way the light is captured, especially on the tables and chairs, gives a sense of warmth and activity. Van Gogh's style often includes these elements. 

Degas is known for his ballet dancers and racehorses, so that's probably not this. Klimt is famous for his ornate, decorative works with gold leaf, which doesn't match this painting. Monet's works are more about light and water reflections, like his water lily ponds. This isn't one of his typical subjects.

So, based on the style and subject matter, the answer should be Vincent van Gogh.

The painting in question is **Vincent van Gogh's** *Café Terrace at Night*. His distinctive style, characterized by bold brushstrokes and vibrant colors, is evident in the warm yellow-orange hues of the café and the swirling night sky. The subject of a café terrace at night aligns with Van Gogh's iconic series of such scenes painted in Arles, France. 

**Answer:** B. Vincent van Gogh
