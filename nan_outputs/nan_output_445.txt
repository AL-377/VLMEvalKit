Okay, let's see. The question is about determining whether unemployment in Santher's economy is relatively high or low based on the given AD (aggregate demand) and AS (aggregate supply) data. The options are A, B, or C. 

First, I need to recall what AD and AS curves represent. AD is the total demand for goods and services in an economy, while AS is the total supply. The equilibrium occurs where AD equals AS. At that point, the price level is determined, and the quantity of goods and services produced is also determined. 

Unemployment typically occurs when the quantity demanded doesn't equal the quantity supplied. If AD is less than AS, there's excess supply, which can lead to unemployment as firms reduce production. Conversely, if AD is greater than AS, there's excess demand, which might lead to inflation and higher prices but not necessarily higher unemployment. 

Looking at the table, let's check the equilibrium price levels where AD equals AS. 

Looking at the data:

At Price Level 50: AD is 1000, AS is 250. AD > AS here, so excess demand. 

At Price Level 60: AD is 950, AS is 580. Still AD > AS. 

At Price Level 70: AD is 900, AS is 750. AD > AS. 

At Price Level 80: AD is 850, AS is 850. AD equals AS. 

At Price Level 90: AD is 800, AS is 900. AD < AS. 

So the equilibrium is at Price Level 80, where both AD and AS are 850. 

Now, when AD equals AS, the economy is at full employment. If AD is greater than AS, there's inflationary pressure, but unemployment might not necessarily be high. However, if AD is less than AS, there's deflationary pressure, but again, unemployment might not be high. 

Wait, but in this case, the equilibrium is at 80. Let's check the unemployment rate. Unemployment rate is typically calculated as (Unemployed / Labor Force) * 100. But we don't have data on the labor force or the number of unemployed. So maybe we can't calculate the exact unemployment rate. 

Alternatively, maybe the question is referring to the concept that when AD equals AS, the economy is at full employment, so unemployment is low. But if AD is less than AS, unemployment could be high. However, in this case, the equilibrium is at 80 where AD equals AS. So maybe the unemployment rate is low. 

But wait, the options are A, B, or C. Option A says the unemployment rate is high, B low, C not certain. 

But how can we be sure? If the economy is at equilibrium where AD equals AS, that's typically full employment. So maybe the unemployment rate is low. But the options don't have a "full employment" option. The closest is B: low. 

Alternatively, maybe the question is testing whether the economy is in a recession or not. If AD is less than AS, then there's excess supply, which can lead to unemployment. But in this case, the equilibrium is at 80 where AD equals AS. So maybe the unemployment rate is low. 

But perhaps the answer is C: not certain, because we don't have information about the labor market. The table only shows AD and AS. Without knowing the labor force or the number of unemployed, we can't calculate the exact unemployment rate. So maybe the answer is C. 

Wait, but the question is phrased as "Would you expect unemployment in this economy to be relatively high or low?" So if the economy is at equilibrium where AD equals AS, then it's at full employment, so unemployment is low. But if the economy is not at equilibrium, then unemployment could be high. But in this case, the equilibrium is at 80. So maybe the answer is B. 

But I need to think again. Let's check the data again. At Price Level 80, both AD and AS are 850. So that's the equilibrium. So the economy is in equilibrium, which typically implies full employment. Therefore, unemployment should be low. So the answer is B. 

But wait, the options are A, B, C. So if the equilibrium is at 80, then the unemployment rate is low. Therefore, the correct answer is B. 

Alternatively, maybe the question is a trick. If the economy is not at equilibrium, then unemployment could be high. But in this case, the equilibrium is at 80. So maybe the answer is B. 

Alternatively, maybe the question is about the concept that when AD equals AS, unemployment is low. So the answer is B. 

Therefore, I think the correct answer is B.

To determine whether unemployment in Santher's economy is relatively high or low, we analyze the equilibrium point where aggregate demand (AD) equals aggregate supply (AS). 

From the table:
- At **Price Level 80**, AD = 850 and AS = 850, indicating equilibrium.
- At **Price Levels below 80**, AD > AS (e.g., 50, 60, 70), suggesting excess demand and inflationary pressure.
- At **Price Levels above 80**, AD < AS (e.g., 90), indicating excess supply and deflationary pressure.

The equilibrium at **Price Level 80** implies the economy is at full employment, where the quantity demanded equals the quantity supplied. This typically results in **low unemployment**. While the table does not provide labor market data, the equilibrium suggests the economy is not experiencing significant unemployment. 

**Answer:** B. the unemployment rate for this economy is low.
