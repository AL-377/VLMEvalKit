Okay, so I need to figure out which histological feature in part A of the image is consistent with Crohn's disease. The options are fissuring ulcer, sinus tract, fistula formation, or non-caseating granuloma. Let me start by recalling what each of these terms means in the context of Crohn's disease.

First, Crohn's disease is a chronic inflammatory bowel disease that can affect any part of the gastrointestinal tract. Histologically, it's characterized by transmural inflammation, which means inflammation that affects all layers of the intestinal wall. The key features include granulomas, crypt abscesses, and fibrosis. 

Looking at the image, part A seems to show a section of intestinal tissue with some inflammation. The structures that look like villi or crypts are present, but there's a cluster of cells in the center of part A. Since the question is about a histological feature, I need to focus on the cellular components rather than the overall architecture.

Fissuring ulcer: These are deep ulcers that penetrate the entire thickness of the intestinal wall. They might be seen in Crohn's disease, but I'm not sure if that's a common feature. Sinus tract and fistula formation are more about connecting structures, like between different parts of the gut or to other organs. So those might be more related to the clinical presentation rather than the histology.

Non-caseating granuloma: This is a hallmark of Crohn's disease. Granulomas are collections of macrophages and lymphocytes that don't form a central caseous necrosis (which is seen in tuberculosis). So if part A has a granuloma, that would be a strong clue.

Looking at the image, part A has a cluster of cells. If they are macrophages and lymphocytes, that could be a granuloma. The surrounding tissue might show inflammation. However, without seeing the image, I have to rely on my knowledge. Since the question is about a histological feature, and granulomas are a key feature of Crohn's, I think the answer is D. Non-caseating granuloma.

The histological feature consistent with Crohn's disease in part A is a **non-caseating granuloma**. This is a hallmark of Crohn's disease, characterized by collections of macrophages and lymphocytes without central necrosis. While other options like fissuring ulcers or fistula formation are clinical features, granulomas are a definitive histological marker. 

**Answer:** D. Non-caseating granuloma
