Okay, let's try to figure out this question. So, there are two images here. The first one is a drawing of a Maroon resistance fighter from Jamaica around 1796. The second image is a map showing major Cossack hosts in the former Russian Empire. The question is asking which context these two images fit best together, with options A to D.

First, let's look at the first image. It's a Maroon fighter. Maroons are people who escaped slavery and formed their own communities, often in remote areas. They were known for resisting against slave owners and maintaining their freedom. The fact that this is from 1796 suggests that it's during the time of the transatlantic slave trade, which was a significant period of resistance. So, Maroons were part of societies that had escaped from slavery and were fighting to maintain their freedom.

Now, the second image is a map of Cossack hosts in the Russian Empire. Cossacks were military groups that originated in the steppes of Eastern Europe. They were known for their military prowess and played a significant role in the Russian military. The map shows various regions like Don, Kuban, Terek, etc. These regions were on the periphery of the Russian Empire, often in areas that were more remote or less controlled by the central government. The Cossacks were a sort of frontier society, maintaining their own traditions and sometimes resisting the central government's authority.

So, putting both together. The Maroon communities were in Jamaica, which was part of the British Empire, and they were resisting slavery. The Cossacks were in the Russian Empire, on the periphery, maintaining their own culture and often acting as a buffer zone between the central government and the more distant regions. Both groups were societies that existed on the periphery of larger states. They had their own communities, often resisting central authority or maintaining their own traditions. 

Looking at the options: A is about societies of refugees from slavery, which fits the Maroons. B is about schismatic religions, which doesn't seem to apply here. C is about societies governed by warrior elites, which could fit both, but maybe more so the Cossacks. D is about societies existing on the periphery of large states, which seems to fit both. 

But wait, the question says "when taken together, both images above are best understood in which of the following contexts?" So, both images together. The Maroons were in a British colony resisting slavery, and the Cossacks were in the Russian Empire on the periphery. So, the context would be societies that existed on the periphery of large states. That would be option D. 

Alternatively, maybe there's a connection between the Maroons and Cossacks in terms of resistance, but the question is about the context in which both images are best understood together. So, the periphery of large states is the common thread. The Maroons were in a colony, the Cossacks were in a Russian Empire. Both were on the margins. So, the answer is D.

The two images depict Maroon resistance fighters in Jamaica and Cossack hosts in the Russian Empire. Both groups existed on the periphery of larger states: Maroons in a British colony resisting slavery, and Cossacks in the Russian Empire as frontier communities. Their shared context is their marginalization and resistance against central authority. 

**Answer:** D. Societies existing on the periphery of large states.
