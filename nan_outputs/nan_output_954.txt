Okay, let's see. The question is asking which part of the brain the arrow is pointing to. The options are parietal lobe, temporal lobes, cerebral cortex, or occipital lobe. 

First, I need to recall the different parts of the brain and their locations. The brain is divided into several lobes. The parietal lobe is usually on the top and back part of the brain, right? The temporal lobes are on the sides, near the ears. The occipital lobe is at the back of the head, involved in vision. The cerebral cortex is the outer layer of the cerebrum, which is the largest part of the brain. 

Looking at the image, the arrow is pointing to a pink area. In the diagram, the pink part is on the side of the brain, near the front. The cerebral cortex is the outer layer, so if the arrow is pointing to a specific area within the cortex, maybe it's a specific region. But the options are general parts. 

Wait, the cerebral cortex is the entire outer layer. So if the arrow is pointing to a specific part of the cortex, but the options are the lobes. Hmm. Maybe the arrow is pointing to a specific lobe. Let me think. The parietal lobe is on the top, temporal on the sides, occipital at the back. The arrow is pointing to the side, near the front. So maybe the temporal lobes? But the options are A, B, C, D. Let me check again. 

Alternatively, maybe the arrow is pointing to the frontal lobe, but that's not an option. The options given are parietal, temporal, cerebral cortex, or occipital. The arrow is pointing to a pink area on the side. The temporal lobes are on the sides, so that's possible. But the cerebral cortex is the entire outer layer. If the arrow is pointing to a specific part of the cortex, but the options are the lobes. Hmm. Maybe the answer is B. Temporal lobes. Because the arrow is pointing to the side, which is where the temporal lobes are located. 

Alternatively, maybe the arrow is pointing to the frontal lobe, but that's not an option. The options are parietal, temporal, cerebral cortex, or occipital. So if the arrow is pointing to the side, near the front, maybe it's the frontal part of the temporal lobe? But I'm not sure. 

Wait, the cerebral cortex is the entire outer layer. So if the arrow is pointing to a specific part of the cortex, but the options are the lobes. Maybe the answer is B. Temporal lobes. Because the arrow is pointing to the side, which is where the temporal lobes are. The parietal is on the top, occipital at the back. So yes, the arrow is pointing to the temporal lobes. So the answer should be B.

The arrow in the figure points to the **temporal lobes** (Option B). The temporal lobes are located on the sides of the brain, near the ears, and are responsible for processing auditory information and memory. The other options—parietal lobe (top/back), cerebral cortex (outer layer), and occipital lobe (back)—are either general brain regions or not specifically indicated by the arrow. 

**Answer:** B. temporal lobes
