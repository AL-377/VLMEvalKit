Okay, let's see. The question is asking for the written-out ornament that's marked with a bracket in the given music notation. The options are acciaccatura, appoggiatura, lower mordent, and upper turns. Hmm, I need to recall what each of these ornaments looks like.

First, I remember that an appoggiatura is a note that's approached but not held, usually with a small slur or bracket. It's like a grace note that's played before the main note. The bracket is typically placed above the note, right? So if the bracket is above the note, that would be an appoggiatura. Let me check the options again. Option B is appoggiatura. So maybe that's the answer.

Now, let's look at the music notation. The note in question has a bracket above it. The other options: acciaccatura is a similar concept but usually with a small slur and a dot, and it's a quicker grace note. The mordent is a different ornament, like a turn, which can be a lower or upper mordent. A lower mordent is a turn that goes down, and an upper mordent goes up. But the bracket here is above the note, so it's more likely an appoggiatura. 

Wait, the options are written as acciaccatura, appoggiatura, lower mordent, upper turns. The bracket is above the note, so the appoggiatura is the one with a bracket above. So the answer should be B. Let me just make sure I'm not confusing them. Appoggiatura is a grace note that's approached but not held, often with a bracket above. Yes, that's correct. So the answer is B.

The ornament marked with a bracket in the music notation is an **appoggiatura**. This ornament is characterized by a bracket above the note, indicating a grace note that precedes the main note without being held. 

**Answer:** B. appoggiatura
