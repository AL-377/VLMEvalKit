Okay, let's see. The question is asking which term refers to a play that deals with tragic events. The options are Tragedy, Comedy, Drama, and Plot. Hmm. First, I need to recall what each of these terms means in the context of theater.

Tragedy, right? I remember that a tragedy is a serious play that usually involves a tragic hero who faces great misfortune. The hero often makes a fatal mistake, and the play ends with a tragic outcome. Examples include plays like "Oedipus Rex" or "Hamlet." So if the play is about tragic events, Tragedy would be the answer.

Comedy, on the other hand, is a play that's meant to be funny. It usually has a happy ending and the characters learn a lesson. So that's not it. Drama is a broader term that can include both tragedies and comedies, so that's not specific enough. Plot is the sequence of events in a story, which is part of a play but not the genre itself. So the answer should be Tragedy.

Wait, but let me make sure I'm not confusing any terms. Drama is sometimes used as a synonym for tragedy, but actually, in theater, Drama is more general. Tragedy is a specific type. So yes, Tragedy is the correct answer here. The other options don't fit because Comedy is about humor, Drama is too vague, and Plot is about the story structure. So the answer must be A.

The term that refers to a play dealing with tragic events is **A. Tragedy**. 

**Explanation:**  
- **Tragedy** involves serious, often fatal outcomes, typically centered on a "tragic hero" who faces misfortune due to flaws or external forces.  
- **Comedy** focuses on humor and positive resolutions.  
- **Drama** is a broad category encompassing both tragedies and comedies.  
- **Plot** refers to the sequence of events, not the genre.  

Thus, the correct answer is **A. Tragedy**.
