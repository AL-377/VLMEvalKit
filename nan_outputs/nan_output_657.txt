Okay, let's see. The question is asking which term refers to adventure stories with a search motif. The options are Fable, Humorous Tale, Theme, and Quest Stories. The image provided is a DVD cover for "The Lord of the Rings," which is a well-known fantasy adventure film. 

First, I need to recall what each term means. A fable is a short story that teaches a moral lesson, often using animals or personified objects. So that's probably not it. A humorous tale would be a story that's funny, like a comedy. That doesn't fit either. Theme refers to the central idea or message of a work, like "the theme of love." That's not a type of story. 

Then there's Quest Stories. I remember that in literature, a quest is a journey undertaken by a character to achieve a specific goal. The classic example is the hero's journey, where the hero goes on a quest, faces challenges, and returns with a treasure or learns a lesson. "The Lord of the Rings" is a quest story where Frodo and his companions travel to destroy the One Ring. So the search motif here is the quest itself. 

Wait, the question mentions "search motif." A search motif is when the main character or characters are searching for something, like a treasure, a person, or a truth. In "The Lord of the Rings," the search is for the One Ring, which ties into the quest. So the term that refers to such stories would be Quest Stories. 

Let me double-check. The options are A to D. The answer is likely D. Quest Stories. Yeah, that makes sense. The other options don't fit the context of adventure stories with a search element. Fable is too moralistic, humorous tale is about comedy, and theme is about the message. So D is correct.

The term that refers to adventure stories with a search motif is **D. Quest Stories**. These narratives typically involve a journey or quest where characters seek a specific goal, often tied to a central artifact or challenge. The example provided, *The Lord of the Rings*, exemplifies this structure, where the protagonists embark on a quest to destroy the One Ring. 

**Answer:** D. Quest Stories
