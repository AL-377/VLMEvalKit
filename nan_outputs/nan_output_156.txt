Okay, so I need to figure out which of the options A to D correctly identifies the influence of Western art in this image. Let me start by analyzing the image itself. The illustration appears to be a traditional Persian miniature, which is typically associated with Islamic art. These are often characterized by their intricate details, calligraphy, and symbolic imagery. However, the question is about Western art influence, so I need to look for elements that might be borrowed from European art traditions.

First, let's look at the options:

A. Classical contrapposto: This is a term used in Western art to describe the stance where a figure's weight is shifted onto one leg, causing the torso to twist, creating a sense of movement. This is a common pose in classical Greek and Roman sculpture, like the Discobolus or the Apollo Belvedere. If the figure in the image is depicted in this way, that would be a Western influence.

B. Atmospheric perspective: Also known as aerial perspective, this technique involves using lighter colors and less detail in the background to create the illusion of distance. It's a method used in Western painting to create depth. If the background of the image is less detailed and uses lighter colors, that could be an example of this.

C. Di sotto in sù: This is an Italian term meaning "from below upwards," referring to a technique where the artist looks up at a subject, often used in religious paintings to emphasize the divine nature of the subject. It's more of a compositional technique rather than a specific artistic style. I'm not sure how directly this relates to Western art influence here.

D. Tenebrism: This is a dramatic use of light and shadow, creating strong contrasts between light and dark areas. It's a technique popularized by Caravaggio and others in the Baroque period. If the image uses heavy chiaroscuro, that would be tenebrism.

Now, let's analyze the image. The central figure is a man on horseback, dressed in traditional attire. The background includes trees and possibly a landscape. The figure is depicted in a dynamic pose, but the overall composition seems to follow traditional Persian miniature styles. However, the question is about Western influence, so maybe there's a specific element here.

Looking at the options again:

A. Classical contrapposto: The figure's pose might be similar to classical statues, but I don't see any clear evidence of that here. The posture seems more dynamic and perhaps inspired by Persian traditions rather than classical Western art.

B. Atmospheric perspective: The background seems to have a gradient, with darker trees in the foreground and lighter, less detailed areas in the background. This could be atmospheric perspective, which is a Western technique. If the trees in the background are less detailed and the colors are lighter, that would fit.

C. Di sotto in sù: The composition might be looking up, but again, this is more of a compositional technique rather than a Western artistic style. The image doesn't seem to emphasize a divine subject in a way that would require this technique.

D. Tenebrism: The use of light and shadow is subtle. The figure is shaded, but the overall lighting seems even. There's no strong contrast between light and dark areas that would suggest tenebrism.

Considering all this, the most plausible answer is B. Atmospheric perspective. The background trees are darker and more detailed in the foreground, becoming lighter and less detailed in the background, which is a technique used in Western art to create depth. The other options don't seem to fit as well with the elements present in the image.

The image depicts a traditional Persian miniature, but the question asks for Western art influence. Key elements in the background, such as darker, more detailed trees in the foreground transitioning to lighter, less detailed areas in the distance, align with **atmospheric perspective** (option B). This technique, common in Western art, creates depth by using color and detail to simulate distance. While the figure's pose may echo classical contrapposto (option A), the compositional depth is more indicative of Western atmospheric perspective. Di sotto in sù (C) and tenebrism (D) are less relevant here. 

**Answer:** B. atmospheric perspective
